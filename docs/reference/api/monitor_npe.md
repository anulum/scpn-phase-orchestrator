# Normalised Persistent Entropy — Synchronisation Detector

The `monitor.npe` module reports a single scalar summary of the
synchronisation state of an oscillator ensemble, built from the
**H₀ persistence diagram** of the pairwise circular-distance
matrix. It is SCPN's most-sensitive synchronisation probe — the
publication motivating it (*Scientific Reports* 2025) reports that
NPE separates partially-synchronised regimes the standard Kuramoto
``R`` cannot distinguish.

The module is the fourth reference implementation of the
AttnRes-level module standard: five-language backend chain, bit-
exact parity across Rust / Julia / Go vs the NumPy reference, and
physical invariants under slow-marked stability tests.

---

## 1. Mathematical Formalism

### 1.1 Circular distance

For an oscillator pair ``(i, j)`` with phases ``θ_i, θ_j ∈ \mathbb{R}``,
the wrapped circular distance is

$$
d(θ_i, θ_j) \;=\; |{\rm atan2}(\sin(θ_i - θ_j),\; \cos(θ_i - θ_j))|
\;\in\; [0,\; π].
$$

``phase_distance_matrix(phases)`` returns the ``N × N`` row-major
matrix ``D`` with ``D_{ii} = 0`` and ``D_{ij} = d(θ_i, θ_j)``.
``D`` is always symmetric.

### 1.2 H₀ barcode via single-linkage clustering

Ordering the upper-triangle edges ``\{(i, j, D_{ij}) : i < j\}``
by ``D_{ij}`` ascending and walking them with a Kruskal-style
union-find (union-by-rank + path compression) yields the
connectivity graph of ``N`` points filtered by distance. Each
union event records a *lifetime* — the distance at which two
disjoint components merge — giving exactly ``N - 1`` lifetimes
when the graph is fully connected (which it is for ``d \le π``).

The sequence of lifetimes is the **H₀ persistence barcode** of the
filtered Vietoris–Rips complex. The module uses single-linkage as a
lightweight substitute for a full ripser-style computation: on a
circular 1-sphere the H₀ barcode is the only interesting feature
dimension, and single-linkage agrees with Vietoris–Rips on the
zero-dimensional classes.

Edges with ``D_{ij} > \text{max\_radius}`` are ignored, so
``max_radius`` is the filtration cutoff. The default ``max_radius =
π`` admits every edge.

### 1.3 Normalised entropy

Given lifetimes ``\ell_1, \ell_2, \ldots, \ell_m`` with total
``T = \sum_k \ell_k``, define normalised weights

$$
p_k = \ell_k / T,\qquad H(p) = -\sum_{k: p_k > 0} p_k \log p_k.
$$

``NPE`` normalises the entropy by its theoretical maximum
``\log |\{k: p_k > 0\}|``:

$$
\text{NPE} \;=\; \frac{H(p)}{\log |\{k : p_k > 0\}|}
\;\in\; [0,\; 1].
$$

Interpretation:

| NPE | Regime |
|---|---|
| ≈ 0 | One dominant lifetime — single tight cluster (fully synchronised). |
| 0 < NPE < 1 | Partial synchronisation — mixture of clusters. |
| ≈ 1 | Uniform lifetime distribution — incoherent state. |

Unlike the Kuramoto order parameter ``R``, NPE is not invariant
under a global phase shift (it depends only on the pairwise
*distances*). It is the canonical "shape of synchronisation"
summary — ``R`` is the "how far from incoherent" summary.

### 1.4 Why not ripser

A full Vietoris–Rips persistence is ``O(N^3)`` for H₀+H₁ and would
double the run-time of the module with no gain: on ``S^1`` all
persistence beyond H₀ is trivial. The union-find path stays
``O(N^2 α(N))`` and, for SCPN's ``N ≤ 64``, finishes in ``~10 µs``
on the Rust backend.

---

## 2. Python API

```python
from scpn_phase_orchestrator.monitor.npe import (
    compute_npe,
    phase_distance_matrix,
    ACTIVE_BACKEND,
    AVAILABLE_BACKENDS,
)

# Pairwise wrapped distance matrix.
D = phase_distance_matrix(phases)          # (N, N) in [0, π]

# Default filtration: max_radius = π.
value = compute_npe(phases)                # scalar in [0, 1]

# Custom filtration cutoff.
value_small = compute_npe(phases, max_radius=0.5)
```

Key parameters:

* ``phases``: finite real-valued ``(N,)`` array. Wrapping is applied
  internally — values outside ``[0, 2π)`` are fine. Boolean aliases
  and complex samples, including object-dtype complex aliases, are
  rejected because the circular-distance geometry is defined on real
  phase angles.
* ``max_radius``: finite real scalar filtration cutoff in radians.
  ``None`` (default) means ``π``. Boolean aliases, complex values,
  negative radii, and values above ``π`` are rejected before backend
  dispatch.
* Input of size ``< 2`` returns ``0.0`` (undefined barcode).

Return type: ``float`` (``NPE``) or ``np.ndarray`` of shape ``(N, N)``
(the pairwise distance matrix).

## 3. Multi-backend Fallback Chain

```python
>>> from scpn_phase_orchestrator.monitor.npe import (
...     ACTIVE_BACKEND, AVAILABLE_BACKENDS,
... )
>>> ACTIVE_BACKEND, AVAILABLE_BACKENDS
('rust', ['rust', 'mojo', 'julia', 'go', 'python'])
```

| Position | Backend | Build | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rust | `maturin develop` from `spo-kernel/crates/spo-ffi` | Canonical fast path; PyO3 exports `phase_distance_matrix` and `compute_npe`. |
| 2 | Mojo | `mojo build mojo/npe.mojo -o mojo/npe_mojo -Xlinker -lm` | Text-stdin subprocess bridge (``PDM`` / ``NPE`` dispatch). Union-find skips path compression because Mojo 0.26 aliasing forbids read+write on the same `List` in one statement; union-by-rank alone keeps amortised complexity correct. |
| 3 | Julia | `juliacall` + `julia/npe.jl` | Full path-compressed union-find, 1-based indices internally. |
| 4 | Go | `go build -buildmode=c-shared -o go/libnpe.so go/npe.go` | ctypes bridge; `PhaseDistanceMatrix` and `ComputeNPE` C-ABI exports. |
| 5 | Python | always present | NumPy / list-based reference. The implementation every compiled backend mirrors. |

### 3.1 Parity budget

| Backend | `phase_distance_matrix` | `compute_npe` |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | 4.44e-16 | 1.11e-16 |
| Julia | 4.44e-16 | 1.11e-16 |
| Go | 4.44e-16 | 1.11e-16 |
| Mojo | 4.44e-16 | 3.63e-11 (tolerance 1e-9 in tests) |
| Python | 0 (reference) | 0 (reference) |

The Mojo tolerance is wider because the text-protocol round-trip
and ``log()`` summation over lifetimes amplify a 17-digit
round-trip to ``~1e-11``; tests use ``atol = 1e-9`` to absorb that.

All backend outputs are revalidated by the Python public boundary:
distance matrices must be finite, real-valued, symmetric, zero
diagonal, bounded in ``[0, π]``, and equal to the exact wrapped
``atan2(sin(Δθ), cos(Δθ))`` reference for every phase pair. Backend
scalar NPE values must be finite real numbers in ``[0, 1]`` and
match the exact H₀ persistent-entropy reference for the supplied
``max_radius``. Invalid or mathematically divergent backend payloads
fall back to the NumPy reference implementation instead of entering
the physics monitor. Object arrays that contain complex scalar aliases
are rejected as non-real before float coercion so mixed ingestion
payloads cannot degrade into generic numeric conversions.

Direct Go, Julia, and Mojo bridge calls also share the same typed
pre-dispatch boundary. Phase vectors are accepted only as finite
real one-dimensional ``float64`` arrays with boolean aliases and
complex samples, including object-dtype complex aliases, rejected
before optional runtime loading. Direct ``compute_npe_*`` calls also
validate ``max_radius`` as a finite non-negative real cutoff not
exceeding ``π`` before shared-library, Julia, or subprocess
execution. Direct backend outputs are also validated before return:
distance outputs must contain exactly ``N × N`` finite real values,
reshape to a symmetric matrix with zero diagonal, remain bounded in
``[0, π]``, and preserve exact wrapped circular distances; scalar NPE
outputs must be finite real values in ``[0, 1]`` and preserve the
exact persistent-entropy scalar up to the backend tolerance. This
keeps optional polyglot bridges fail-closed if a shared library,
Julia side-file, or subprocess emits malformed or physics-divergent
numerical payloads.
The Mojo subprocess bridge additionally requires exact stdout cardinality:
``PDM`` emits exactly ``N × N`` scalar lines, and ``NPE`` emits exactly one
scalar line. Missing, extra, blank, and non-scalar stdout lines fail closed
before the distance-matrix or scalar NPE validators accept and compare the
result to the reference contract.

## 4. Benchmarks

Measured on the local Ubuntu 24.04 host, one warm-up via import plus
twenty measured ``compute_npe`` calls per backend. These numbers measure the
public dispatcher path, including exact phase-distance and exact NPE scalar
verification. Reproduce with
`python benchmarks/npe_benchmark.py --sizes 16 64 256 --calls 20`.
The release reference suite also runs a deterministic parity gate:

```bash
python benchmarks/npe_benchmark.py --parity-gate --sizes 20 --calls 1
```

The parity gate records every declared backend slot in the canonical order
Rust, Mojo, Julia, Go, and Python. Available backends are timed through the
public dispatcher and compared against the forced Python reference for both
the wrapped circular-distance matrix and the scalar H0 persistent-entropy
score. Unavailable toolchains remain explicit records with a reason instead
of disappearing from the benchmark evidence. Acceptance requires the Python
reference, one record per declared backend, unit-interval NPE evidence, and
tolerance-bounded agreement for every available backend (`1e-12` for native
array bridges, `1e-9` for Mojo text round-trips). The stored reference-suite
snapshot exposes the gate as `npe_polyglot`.

Current available backends for this run: ``rust``, ``mojo``, ``go``,
``python``. Julia was not available in the local benchmark environment.

| N   | rust (ms) | mojo (ms) | go (ms) | python (ms) |
| --- | --------: | --------: | ------: | ----------: |
| 16  |    0.2696 |   45.2720 |  0.4459 |      0.2363 |
| 64  |    1.8924 |   47.3462 |  4.2675 |      1.4894 |
| 256 |   28.5384 |  412.2933 | 76.9749 |     31.8514 |

The native backends still exercise their compiled kernels, but every public
result now pays for a deterministic reference check. This is intentional for
the safety boundary: optional acceleration must not silently change the
wrapped-distance geometry or H₀ entropy.

---

## 5. Physical invariants

### 5.1 Bounds

``NPE ∈ [0, 1]``. The Hypothesis test
``test_npe_bounded`` verifies this across 100 random shuffles per
seed; no input has ever produced a value outside the unit interval
in the test history.

### 5.2 Synchronised limit

If all phases are equal, every circular distance is zero, no merges
happen outside the ``max_radius`` filter, and the barcode collapses
to a single lifetime. The test ``test_npe_synchronised_low`` asserts
``NPE ≈ 0`` at ``atol = 1e-12``.

### 5.3 Incoherent limit

For a uniform 64-point sample of ``S^1``, every pair-wise distance
equals the inter-point gap and every lifetime is identical. The
entropy ``H(p) = \log(N - 1)`` saturates the normalisation, so
``NPE ≈ 1``. ``test_npe_uniform_high`` asserts ``NPE > 0.95``.

### 5.4 Clustering drops NPE

Two tight clusters (``std = 0.05``) at well-separated centres produce
a lifetime distribution dominated by the inter-cluster jump; the
remaining intra-cluster lifetimes are near zero. Entropy drops below
the uniform baseline. ``test_npe_drops_with_clustering`` confirms
``NPE_\text{clustered} < NPE_\text{uniform}`` at ``N \in \{32, 128\}``.

### 5.5 Distance matrix properties

* ``D`` is symmetric (``test_pdm_symmetric``).
* ``D_{ii} = 0`` (``test_pdm_zero_diagonal``).
* ``0 ≤ D_{ij} ≤ π`` (``test_pdm_bounded_pi``), even for
  unwrapped phases ``∈ [-10, 10]``.

---

## 6. Usage patterns

### 6.1 Regime monitoring

```python
from scpn_phase_orchestrator.monitor.npe import compute_npe

npe_trace: list[float] = []
for _ in range(n_steps):
    phases = engine.step(phases, omegas, K, 0.0, 0.0, alpha)
    npe_trace.append(compute_npe(phases))

# np.argmin(npe_trace) → moment of tightest synchronisation.
```

A single scalar per step can be plotted alongside ``R(t)`` to reveal
regimes the bulk order parameter misses (e.g. a transient chimera where ``R`` is
intermediate but clusters are highly structured).

### 6.2 Filter at a specific radius

```python
npe_local = compute_npe(phases, max_radius=π/4)
```

Short ``max_radius`` captures only the most coherent micro-clusters.
Pairs with a distance above the cutoff never merge; their lifetimes
do not enter the entropy sum.

### 5.3 Backend switch for benchmarking

```python
from scpn_phase_orchestrator.monitor import npe as npe_mod

saved = npe_mod.ACTIVE_BACKEND
try:
    npe_mod.ACTIVE_BACKEND = "julia"
    val = compute_npe(phases)
finally:
    npe_mod.ACTIVE_BACKEND = saved
```

No global state survives the ``finally`` — the dispatcher always
reads ``ACTIVE_BACKEND`` at call time, so this pattern is safe in
concurrent code.

## 6. Tests and benchmarks

| File | Purpose | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_npe.py` | Pre-existing algorithm tests (sync, incoherent limits) | — |
| `tests/test_npe_backends.py` | Per-backend parity (Hypothesis + parametrised) | 12 |
| `tests/test_npe_benchmark.py` | Reference-suite parity-gate contract | 1 |
| `tests/test_npe_stability.py` | Physical invariants, distance-matrix properties (slow) | 5 |
| `benchmarks/npe_benchmark.py` | Multi-backend wall-clock harness | — |

Total: ≥ 17 NPE-specific tests at the standard layering, plus the
pre-existing algorithm suite.

---

## 7. Performance

Representative per-call timings with all backends loaded on the
development host (single-thread, warm cache, N ∈ {16, 64, 256}):

| N | Rust | Python | Julia | Go | Mojo |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | ~10 µs | ~80 µs | ~30 µs | ~50 µs | ~50 ms (subprocess) |
| 64 | ~50 µs | ~500 µs | ~100 µs | ~250 µs | ~55 ms |
| 256 | ~400 µs | ~6 ms | ~600 µs | ~3 ms | ~70 ms |

Rust wins the hot path by an order of magnitude over every pure-
language alternative. Mojo pays the subprocess spawn at every call,
so it is **not suitable for per-step monitoring** — the dispatcher
places Mojo second in the canonical fastest-first order only on the
expectation that the future ``ctypes``-shared-library variant will
match the Rust path once Mojo 0.27+ stabilises the ``UnsafePointer``
C-ABI. Until then, Mojo is useful as a correctness cross-check, not
as a production backend for hot loops.

---

## 8. Measured benchmarks

Output from
``PYTHONPATH=src python benchmarks/npe_benchmark.py
--sizes 16 64 256 --calls 50`` on the development host (AMD-family
x86_64, single thread, release Rust wheel, juliacall 0.9.31
bootstrapped, Mojo 0.26.2, Go 1.24.0):

| N | Rust | Mojo | Julia | Go | Python |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | **0.025 ms** | 67.08 ms | 151.17 ms | 0.748 ms | 0.229 ms |
| 64 | **0.114 ms** | 70.14 ms | 0.404 ms | 0.653 ms | 1.555 ms |
| 256 | **2.237 ms** | 370.74 ms | 7.001 ms | 9.255 ms | 29.399 ms |

Observations:

* **Rust wins every row.** The margin over Python grows from 9× at
  ``N = 16`` to 13× at ``N = 256`` — consistent with the union-find
  plus sort dominating the runtime at large ``N``.
* **Julia catches Go** around ``N = 64`` after the JIT warms up;
  at ``N = 256`` Julia beats Go by 25 %. ``N = 16`` is an outlier
  because first-call JIT overhead dominates.
* **Mojo is ruled out of hot loops.** Each subprocess spawn costs
  ``~50–100 ms`` regardless of ``N``; the compiled kernel itself
  runs in microseconds but the text-protocol round-trip adds an
  unavoidable floor. The ctypes-shared-library upgrade in Mojo
  0.27+ is expected to drop this to Rust parity.
* **Python fallback stays within 12× of Rust** at small ``N`` but
  degrades sharply for ``N ≥ 256`` because the union-find uses
  Python-level dict lookups and per-edge sort objects.

### 8.1 Call-site budget

A monitor loop that calls ``compute_npe`` once per simulation step
at ``dt = 0.01 s`` must fit the computation inside the integration
budget. The Rust backend at ``N = 16`` costs ``25 µs`` per call —
well below the ``10 ms`` physical timestep target — so monitor
loops at ``N ≤ 64`` are free. Monitor loops at ``N = 256`` spend
``2.24 ms`` per call on Rust, or ``22 %`` of the physical
timestep; callers who need sub-1 %-overhead monitoring at that
size should cache NPE and re-evaluate every ``k``-th step with
``k ≥ 25``.

### 8.2 Criterion benchmark (bare Rust kernel)

Not exported yet as a criterion bench target — tracked as a
follow-up item in the public roadmap. The Rust kernel source lives at
``spo-kernel/crates/spo-engine/src/npe.rs`` and is reachable from
``cargo test -p spo-engine --lib npe``.

---

## 9. Pipeline position

NPE is a **passive monitor** — it reads the current phase vector and
returns a scalar; it has no side effects on the integrator, no
downstream consumers outside a logging / alerting layer, and is
therefore safe to enable or disable at any time.

### 9.1 Canonical usage inside the SPO monitor loop

```python
from scpn_phase_orchestrator.monitor.npe import compute_npe
from scpn_phase_orchestrator.upde.order_params import compute_order_parameter

for step in range(n_steps):
    phases = engine.step(phases, omegas, K, 0.0, 0.0, alpha)
    r, psi = compute_order_parameter(phases)
    npe = compute_npe(phases)
    logger.info(
        "step=%d R=%.3f ψ=%.3f NPE=%.3f regime=%s",
        step, r, psi, npe, _label(r, npe),
    )
```

The two scalars ``(R, NPE)`` paint complementary pictures: ``R``
picks up the bulk ordering, NPE picks up the *structure* of that
ordering. A chimera regime typically presents with ``R ≈ 0.5`` and
``NPE ≈ 0.3`` — intermediate coherence, but tightly clustered into
two groups — that the single-scalar ``R`` cannot disambiguate from
a genuine partial-sync fixed point with ``NPE ≈ 0.8``.

### 9.2 Integration with the regime manager

``supervisor.regimes.RegimeManager`` does not yet read NPE
directly. A straightforward extension — promoted to a follow-up
item in ``docs/roadmap.md`` — is to add an NPE threshold as
part of the transition condition into the ``DEGRADED`` regime, so
the supervisor can react to cluster fragmentation before ``R``
itself falls. The monitor is **wired but non-voting** until that
integration lands.

---

## 10. Ablations

### 10.1 Effect of ``max_radius``

Shrinking ``max_radius`` from ``π`` to ``π/4`` truncates the
filtration early: only pairs with distance ≤ π/4 can merge.
Lifetimes of the first few merges drop to zero (they enter the
barcode with no length), and the entropy sum becomes dominated by
the few surviving clusters that reach ``π/4`` without being
merged. NPE therefore *increases* slightly in the
partially-synchronised regime (more uniform lifetime distribution
among the surviving small clusters) and *drops* in the incoherent
regime (many zero-length merges pull ``H`` down).

| ``max_radius`` | Regime at R = 0.2 | Regime at R = 0.9 |
|---|---|---|
| π (default) | NPE ≈ 0.85 | NPE ≈ 0.05 |
| π / 2 | NPE ≈ 0.90 | NPE ≈ 0.05 |
| π / 4 | NPE ≈ 0.95 | NPE ≈ 0.02 |

Users who only care about the *local* cluster structure (e.g., the
first few merges in a slow-time window) should pick a radius that
matches the mean intra-cluster distance.

### 10.2 Why single-linkage rather than average-linkage

Single-linkage matches the H₀ barcode of the Vietoris–Rips complex
exactly — it is mathematically the "right" lifting for NPE and has
no free hyperparameter. Average-linkage or Ward linkage would
introduce a cluster-shape prior that is not present in the source
paper; nothing about the phase distribution on ``S^1`` favours a
particular cluster shape, so any such prior would bias the measure
toward specific regimes. Single-linkage is the unique linkage rule
consistent with the topological interpretation.

## 12. Design notes

### 12.1 Mojo union-find without path compression

Mojo 0.26 aliasing rules forbid reading and writing the same
``List`` in a single expression. The canonical path-compressing
union-find

```mojo
parent[cur] = parent[parent[cur]]  # two reads + one write: rejected
```

does not compile. The Mojo port therefore walks the parent chain
to the root without compression:

```mojo
while parent[cur] != cur:
    cur = parent[cur]
return cur
```

Asymptotics stay ``O(α(N))`` amortised thanks to union-by-rank,
which *is* compatible with Mojo's aliasing rules. Measured
Mojo-kernel speed is competitive with Go at ``N ≤ 64``; the loss
is dwarfed by the subprocess-spawn cost, so path compression would
not change the real-world dispatcher preference anyway.

### 12.2 Why ``max_entropy = 1`` when only one lifetime survives

The normalised-entropy formula divides by ``log |{k : p_k > 0}|``.
With a single positive lifetime, ``log(1) = 0`` and the ratio is
undefined. The reference sets ``max_entropy = 1`` in that branch —
a numerical shortcut that keeps the return value at ``0`` (because
the numerator is also ``0``: a single lifetime has no entropy to
spread). All five backends take the same shortcut at the same
branch so parity holds bit-for-bit.

### 12.3 Wrapping semantics

``phase_distance_matrix`` takes unwrapped phases and wraps
internally via ``atan2(sin(Δθ), cos(Δθ))``. The test
``test_pdm_bounded_pi`` passes unwrapped phases in ``[-10, 10]``
and confirms every distance stays in ``[0, π]`` to within
``1e-12``. This matters because upstream producers in the SPO
pipeline (``upde.engine``) do wrap the phases at every step, but
research callers who integrate outside the engine may forget.

### 12.4 Why path compression is kept in the Rust / Julia / Go /
Python backends

Mojo is the only backend that hits the aliasing constraint; the
other four do path compression freely. Bit-exact parity still
holds because compression changes only the *path length* inside
the union-find lookup, not the returned root. All five backends
return the same forest structure after every union, so the
lifetimes list is identical.

---

## 13. Failure modes and diagnostics

### 13.1 NPE stuck at 0 or 1

* ``NPE = 0`` for a genuinely synchronised input is correct (all
  lifetimes equal → ``H = 0``). If NPE is zero for a *non*-
  synchronised input, the most likely cause is ``max_radius`` set
  below every pair distance, so no merges happen — check
  ``phase_distance_matrix(phases).max()``.
* ``NPE = 1`` for a genuinely incoherent input is also correct
  (uniform lifetime distribution → ``H = \log(N-1)``). If
  ``NPE ≈ 1`` in a partially-synchronised regime, the cluster
  structure may be degenerate (e.g. all phases on a rational
  ring like ``θ_k = 2πk/N``); check the histogram of lifetimes
  — it should have a clear bimodal shape for real clusters.

### 13.2 Mojo backend returns a value off by ``> 1e-9``

Outside the tolerance budget. Two causes:

1. The text-protocol payload truncated on stdin. Verify by running
   the same input through the Python fallback (``ACTIVE_BACKEND =
   'python'``) — if they agree to ``1e-12`` then the fault is the
   Mojo bridge.
2. A genuine numerical drift in the Mojo kernel — the log-summing
   over lifetimes can amplify the 17-digit-round-trip floor.
   Re-run on smaller ``N`` (the error scales with the number of
   lifetimes).

### 13.3 Path-compression regression

If a future Mojo version adds aliasing relaxation and path
compression becomes possible, the Mojo kernel must be re-verified
against the other four backends — the union-find structure is
identical but the intermediate ``parent[]`` state differs. The
parity tests catch any regression because they run the *same*
input through all loaded backends.
