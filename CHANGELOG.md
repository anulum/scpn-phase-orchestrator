# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Raised dependency security floors so no resolvable version is vulnerable:
  `starlette` ≥ 1.3.1 (`requirements.txt` + the `queuewaves`/`dev` extras),
  `jupyterlab` ≥ 4.5.9, and new floors `jupyter-server` ≥ 2.20.0, `tornado` ≥
  6.5.7, `bleach` ≥ 6.4.0 (`notebook` extra), `msgpack` ≥ 1.2.1 (`dev` extra).
  These are development/notebook-scope tools; the lockfiles already pinned the
  patched versions, so the floors only tighten the declared ranges.
- Upgraded transitive development dependencies in the Python 3.11, Python 3.13,
  and Windows-FFI lockfiles: `jupyter-server` 2.18.0 → 2.20.0 and `bleach` 6.3.0 →
  6.4.0 in all four, plus `cryptography` 47.0.0 → 49.0.0 and `tornado` 6.5.6 →
  6.5.7 in the two Windows-FFI lockfiles. The primary `dev-lock.txt` already
  carried the patched versions. The Windows-FFI lockfiles keep their Unix-only
  exclusions (no `uvloop`).

### Changed

- The domainpack gallery now opens with a **⭐ try these first** guide and badges
  the three recommended starting packs (`power_grid` and `neuroscience_eeg`, each
  one `spo quickstart` command, plus the minimal-spec `minimal_domain`) so a new
  user has an obvious entry point into the 36-pack catalogue, which is searchable
  from the docs search box.
- Documented `experiments/`, `fuzzers/` and `bench/` as an explicit experimental
  tier: each now carries a README stating that it is not part of the supported
  `scpn_phase_orchestrator` API, is outside the test (`testpaths = ["tests"]`) and
  coverage (`source = ["scpn_phase_orchestrator"]`) scope, is held to relaxed
  linting, and carries no stability or correctness guarantee. This makes the
  already-implicit boundary explicit so the exploratory scripts, fuzzing
  harnesses, and benchmark instruments are not mistaken for supported surface.
- The Rust `spo_kernel` extension is now built as an abi3 stable-ABI wheel
  (`pyo3/abi3-py310`): a single `cp310-abi3` wheel per platform loads on CPython
  3.10+ instead of one wheel per Python version, so the release matrix and
  download surface shrink. The build is unchanged for `cargo test`
  (`--no-default-features`); verified that the abi3 wheel imports and the Rust
  Koopman backend runs on a newer interpreter than its 3.10 floor.

### Added

- Hard security scan for `spo validate` (`binding.security_scan` +
  `spo validate --security --hard`): in addition to the spec-level security pass,
  `--hard` statically scans the domainpack's Python scenarios and YAML
  configuration for the patterns that let an untrusted domainpack run arbitrary
  code — dynamic evaluation (`eval` / `exec`), insecure deserialisation
  (`pickle.load`), unsafe YAML deep loads (`yaml.load` without a safe loader or
  `!!python/` tags), and shell command execution — and reports each match with
  its file, line and category. The scan is review-only: it never edits, executes
  or imports the scanned files, so it is safe to run on a domainpack of unknown
  provenance.
- Grounded LLM operator copilot (`reporting.operator_copilot`): turns an
  `ExplainabilityReport` into a question-answering surface for a control-room
  operator. It renders the audit evidence — regime distribution, transitions,
  every control action with its recorded reason and evidence, the metric summary
  — into the prompt and instructs the model to answer only from that evidence and
  to decline when it is silent, so the model explains and locates what the audit
  records rather than inventing control history or recommending actuation. The
  model is any `complete(prompt) -> str` provider (a local HTTP model, or a stub
  for tests), so no network backend is imposed and the prompt is fully testable.
- FMI 3.0 co-simulation export of the Koopman MPC
  (`adapters.fmi_cosimulation`): wraps the controller as an FMI 3.0
  co-simulation slave so a simulation master (Dymola, OpenModelica, FMPy) can
  drive the SPO controller as a block — set the measured state and set point,
  call `do_step`, read back the proposed control. The slave, the
  `modelDescription.xml` generator and the `.fmu` packager are pure NumPy and
  emit a conformant FMI 3.0 model interface; loading inside a third-party FMI
  tool additionally needs the C-ABI binary shim from a separate toolchain. The
  slave reproduces the wrapped controller's control exactly. The reverse import
  direction is `cosimulate`, a co-simulation master that drives the controller
  slave against a plant supplied as a step callable, closing the loop (an
  external plant FMU plugs in by wrapping its FMI runtime such as `fmpy` as that
  callable); on a coupled linear oscillator the master damps the plant.
- Learned phase-autoencoder Koopman observables (`monitor.phase_koopman`): a
  trained phase autoencoder (frozen to the pure-NumPy `oscillators.phase_reduction`
  evaluator) is used as the Koopman observable map, so the EDMD fit and the
  condensed Koopman MPC operate in the learned coordinate where a nonlinear
  oscillator's dynamics are close to linear. `LearnedKoopmanDictionary` satisfies
  the new `KoopmanObservables` protocol (which both the analytic dictionaries and
  the learned map fulfil), and the state-inclusive lift keeps state reconstruction
  exact; on a controlled Stuart–Landau oscillator the learned observables yield a
  predictor competitive with the identity dictionary, typically cutting the
  multi-step state-prediction error (RMSE ratio 0.58–0.88 across seeds). No JAX on
  the control path.
- Closed-loop Koopman-MPC oscillation damping (`runtime.dvoc_oscillation_damping`
  + `spo koopman-mpc`): an underdamped oscillator rings down and the matrix-pencil
  estimator plus the NERC PRC screener flag its poorly-damped mode; an
  EDMD-with-control Koopman predictor is fitted and driven in closed loop by the
  Koopman MPC; the controlled ringdown is re-screened and the weakest mode is
  better damped. The result carries both hash-sealed PRC evidence records, so the
  damping improvement is auditable end to end. This closes the dVOC
  monitor→model→control→assurance chain; it is review-only and offline.
- Model-free phase reduction. `nn.phase_autoencoder` learns the asymptotic
  phase, isochrons and phase-sensitivity function of a limit-cycle oscillator
  from state time series (Yawata, Fukami, Taira & Nakao 2024): a JAX/equinox
  encoder maps the state to a unit-circle latent that evolves by an
  exactly-linear normal-form flow with learnable frequency and decay, trained
  against a four-term loss. The trained weights are extracted to the new
  pure-NumPy `oscillators.phase_reduction` evaluator, which reproduces the
  asymptotic phase and the phase response curve `Z(θ)` with no JAX on the
  control path; the analytic `Z(θ)` matches a finite-difference gradient to
  ~1e-10 and on Stuart–Landau data training recovers the true frequency.
- One-command golden-path demo (`spo quickstart power`): validates, runs,
  replays (audit hash-chain verification) and reports an end-to-end orchestration
  on a bundled research-tier power-grid binding, composing the existing
  validate/run/replay/report APIs. The bundled binding is research-tier so the
  local runtime may execute it; the production `power_grid` domainpack still
  requires the formal-export pipeline. The fastest path from install to a real
  result.
- Review-only Koopman model-predictive controller (`actuation.koopman_mpc`):
  builds the condensed convex quadratic programme of a fitted Koopman predictor
  (Korda & Mezić 2018, eq. 24) over a finite horizon with output tracking, input
  effort, actuator bounds and optional move limits, and returns a content-hashed
  `KoopmanMPCDecision` whose first input is handed to the safety envelope. The
  quadratic programme is solved by a deterministic operator-splitting (ADMM) QP
  floor with adaptive step sizing (the OSQP algorithm of Stellato et al. 2020),
  with an optional `osqp` backend (the `mpc` extra) held to the floor by a
  parity gate. It composes with the foundation-model governor and the control
  barrier filter.
- Koopman EDMD-with-control linear predictor (`monitor.koopman_edmd`): fits a
  data-driven linear model `z_{k+1}=Az_k+Bu_k`, `x̂=Cz_k` of a nonlinear
  controlled system (Korda & Mezić 2018) from snapshot triples through
  Tikhonov-regularised least squares, with identity / polynomial / RBF /
  phase-Fourier observable dictionaries and a frozen `KoopmanPredictor` carrying
  `(A, B, C)`. The least-squares solve runs on the five-language backend chain
  (Rust, Mojo, Julia, Go, Python) at machine-precision cross-backend parity. It
  is the model layer feeding the convex Koopman-MPC controller.
- Foundation-model actuation governor (`actuation.foundation_model_governor`):
  `FoundationModelGovernor.govern` admits an externally-proposed (e.g.
  foundation-model) scalar control only after running it through SPO's safety
  envelope — actuator bounds, a rate limit, an optional Control Barrier Function
  projection (flagging `h(x) < 0`), and named safety predicates that veto — and
  seals each outcome into a content-addressed `GovernorDecision`
  (`admitted` / `constrained` / `rejected`, with the applied stages and
  violations). It competes on governance, not prediction, and is review-only: it
  returns a safe action and an audited decision, never actuating a plant.
- NERC PRC oscillation-monitoring compliance evidence (`assurance.prc_oscillation`):
  `screen_oscillation_modes` screens the damping ratios of detected modes against
  the oscillation-monitoring practice underlying NERC PRC-028 / the proposed
  PRC-030 (undamped and poorly-damped modes are flagged) and seals the result into
  a content-addressed, review-only `PRCOscillationEvidence` record. The capture
  timestamp is caller-supplied so the record is deterministic; it is a technical
  evidence-mapping aid, not a legal conformity assessment, and never actuates.
- Modal participation and damping controllability (`monitor.modal_participation`):
  the model-based companion to the oscillation-mode estimator.
  `phase_network_jacobian` builds the Sakaguchi–Kuramoto small-signal Jacobian at
  an operating point, and `analyse_network_modes` eigen-decomposes any
  continuous-time state matrix into modes carrying frequency, damping ratio, mode
  shape, participation factors (Pérez-Arriaga, Verghese & Schweppe 1982), and
  per-input modal controllability (Kundur 1994). It answers which oscillators
  swing in a poorly-damped inter-area mode and which actuator damps it best;
  conjugate pairs report one non-negative-frequency mode, and a defective state
  matrix is rejected. Diagnostic only.
- Inter-area oscillation mode estimator (`monitor.oscillation_modes`): the
  matrix-pencil method (Hua & Sarkar 1990) recovers the damped-sinusoid modes of
  a grid ringdown — frequency, damping ratio, amplitude, and phase per mode — and
  flags modes whose damping ratio falls below a screening threshold
  (`DEFAULT_DAMPING_THRESHOLD = 0.03`, NERC PRC-028). Conjugate pairs merge into
  one positive-frequency mode; unstable modes report a negative damping ratio.
  Diagnostic only.
- Verified neural Control Barrier Function safety filter
  (`actuation.control_barrier`): a barrier `h(x) ≥ 0` defines a safe set and the
  filter admits the supervisor action closest to its proposal that still
  satisfies the discrete-time CBF condition — an analytic projection onto a
  state-dependent half-space plus an actuator-bounds clip, strictly stronger than
  a fixed clamp. `NeuralBarrier` is a pure-NumPy ReLU network (value, reverse-mode
  gradient, sound interval-bound-propagation bounds); `verify_forward_invariance`
  returns a sound `BarrierCertificate` (IBP over a state-box partition, never a
  false guarantee). Review-only: it shapes a proposed action, never actuates.
- Post-quantum seal over the audit hash chain (`runtime.audit_pqc`):
  `seal_audit_log` signs the chain tip (the SHA-256 commitment to the whole log)
  with ML-DSA (FIPS 204, via `cryptography`), and `verify_audit_log_seal`
  rejects the seal if the log's tip or record count changed after sealing. This
  is an additive, publicly verifiable, post-quantum complement to the existing
  symmetric HMAC record signing — it does not change the HMAC flow. ML-DSA-65 is
  the default (ML-DSA-44/87 selectable); the seal records its algorithm so
  SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) can be added later without breaking existing seals.
- Deterministic (bounded-jitter, hard-deadline) execution mode
  (`runtime.deterministic`): `run_deterministic_loop` drives any per-step
  callable against a fixed period on the monotonic clock, times each step
  against a worst-case execution-time budget (recording or, under
  `miss_policy='abort'`, raising on a deadline miss), and freezes and disables
  the cyclic garbage collector for the hot path so GC pauses leave the jitter
  budget. Returns an `ExecutionTimingReport` with per-step latencies and jitters
  plus mean / max / p99 latency, max absolute jitter, and deadline-miss counts.
  Timing-only and non-actuating.
- Ordinal-pattern transition entropy monitor (`monitor.opt_entropy`,
  `monitor.explosive_sync`): Bandt–Pompe ordinal patterns and the normalised
  Shannon entropy of the consecutive-pattern transition distribution, with a
  five-language backend chain (Rust, Mojo, Julia, Go, Python) at bit-exact
  parity. `explosive_sync_warning` slides this entropy across a multi-node
  signal and raises an early warning when it collapses ahead of a first-order
  (explosive) synchronisation onset, where variance / autocorrelation
  indicators react late. Review-only: it emits a warning record, never actuates.
- Supply-chain provenance for released artefacts, signed keylessly through
  sigstore: PyPI wheels and sdist use PEP 740 attestations; the GitHub-release
  sdist and CycloneDX SBOM are attested with `actions/attest-build-provenance`;
  the container image is pushed with BuildKit provenance and SBOM attestations,
  attested, and signed with cosign. Verification commands are in `SECURITY.md`.
- Conformal twin-confidence admission gate (`monitor.twin_conformal_gate`): turns
  the twin-confidence score into a coverage-valid admit/flag gate. From a nominal
  calibration window it learns a distribution-free threshold on the composite
  z-deviation (target `1 − alpha` coverage) and adapts it online by Adaptive
  Conformal Inference (Gibbs & Candès, 2021), optionally conditioned per detected
  regime. Review-only: a flagged tick signals the twin drifted beyond its
  calibrated band and autonomy should narrow.
- Chaos-engineering resilience injection (`runtime.chaos`, `spo chaos`): inject
  non-actuating faults — coupling drops, frequency drift, sensor noise, and drive
  dropout — into a controlled simulation via the `scenario_hook` boundary, then
  score recovery time, peak coherence drop, stability-margin erosion, and final
  deviation by comparing the nominal and perturbed order-parameter trajectories.
  Review-only; the heavy compute reuses the existing multi-language UPDE engine.
- Online digital-twin confidence scoring (`monitor.twin_confidence`): a
  review-only health observable that turns model–observation disagreement into a
  calibrated confidence in `[0, 1]` plus an operator status, from a phase
  Jensen–Shannon divergence and an order-parameter Wasserstein-1 distance. Ships
  the fastest-first polyglot divergence kernel (Rust, Mojo, Julia, Go, NumPy)
  with bit-exact Rust/Julia/Go parity and a documented `1e-8` Mojo
  text-protocol budget, a calibrator with normal-quantile operating bands, a
  composite-z confidence map, deterministic audit records, multi-angle algorithm
  / parity / stability tests, a Python dispatcher benchmark plus a Rust criterion
  benchmark, and an API reference page.
- Interactive WASM Kuramoto playground (`spo-kernel/crates/spo-wasm/example`):
  the console demo is replaced by a browser simulator with sliders for the
  oscillator count, coupling, time step, and frequency spread, a live phase-ring
  and mean-field canvas, and an order-parameter time series, driven by the
  `WasmEngine` class. Page logic is factored into a pure `simulation.mjs` helper
  module with a `node --test` suite (covering the helpers and a WASM
  synchronisation cross-check) bridged into the Python test run.
- MQTT edge bridge (`adapters.mqtt_bridge`, `mqtt` extra): read-only ingestion of
  edge/IoT sensor measurements from MQTT topics, decoding raw or JSON payloads and
  mapping each topic's sampled waveform to a physical-channel phase state via the
  Hilbert transform. Config, decoding, ingestion, and extraction work without a
  broker; `collect_live` subscribes through `paho-mqtt`. Extends the real-time
  edge-bridge track (ROS2/MQTT/OPC-UA).
- OPC-UA SCADA bridge (`adapters.opcua_bridge`, `opcua` extra): read-only
  ingestion of industrial process tags (temperatures, pressures, flow rates)
  from an OPC-UA server, mapped to physical-channel phase states via the Hilbert
  transform. `OpcUaTag` / `OpcUaBridgeConfig` validate the endpoint and tag
  mapping; `extract_phases` and `collect_samples` work without a network
  dependency, and `read_live` / `collect_live` read from a connected `asyncua`
  client. Closes the OPC-UA adapter request (issue #27).
- Twin-confidence operator surfaces: a `TwinConfidenceSummary` aggregate and
  Prometheus renderer, a `RuntimeObservability.twin_confidence_prometheus_text`
  exporter, and the `spo twin-confidence` CLI command that scores a JSONL
  observation stream against a calibrated baseline with human / JSON / Prometheus
  output and a `--fail-on-critical` gate.

### Repository hygiene

- Enabled strict mypy (`[tool.mypy] strict = true`) and parametrised the
  generic annotations it surfaced across the runtime, binding, adapter,
  reporting, and autotune modules; the package type-checks clean over 502
  source files.
- Adopted NumPy-convention docstrings (ruff `D`) on the public library
  surface under `src/`, with the docstring gate scoped away from tests,
  scripts, benchmarks, vertical packs, fuzz harnesses, examples, and
  notebooks.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Fastest-first polyglot compute chain (Rust, Mojo, Julia, Go, Python) with
  per-backend parity gates registered in the aggregate reference suite for
  time-delayed Kuramoto integration, time-series Williams-Beer PID
  decomposition, combinatorial Hodge decomposition, and E/I-balance
  interaction typing.
- Plain-language introduction on the README and documentation landing page
  covering the problem, cross-domain applications, and value ahead of the
  technical and evidence boundaries.

### Changed

- E/I balance now resolves into the four EI-Kuramoto interaction types.
- Williams-Beer PID rebuilt as a time-series redundancy and synergy estimator
  over a phase history, replacing the constant-target formulation that returned
  zero for all inputs.
- Hodge analysis replaced with a true combinatorial Hodge decomposition across
  the full polyglot chain.
- Version bumped to 0.9.0 across package metadata, the Rust workspace, the
  citation file, and the generated capability inventory.

### Fixed

- Swarmalator coupling uses the canonical OHS inverse-distance repulsion across
  the full polyglot chain.
- Winding-number phase increments wrap to the documented (-pi, pi] interval.
- Poincare phase-section interpolation corrected and covered by a polyglot
  parity gate.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Released the completed PHA-C formal-acceptance boundary across the public
  documentation, package metadata, generated capability inventory, reference
  benchmark snapshot, and release-readiness notes.

- Added acceptance kinematic-equation provenance to
  `PHACKinematicProofObligation` and the PHA-C acceptance benchmark gate so
  Lean-facing formal manifests must remain bound to verified final-position,
  maximum-velocity, and path-length replay evidence.
- Added explicit final-position, maximum-velocity, and path-length equation
  replay to `PHACAcceptanceRecord` and the PHA-C acceptance benchmark gate so
  aggregate acceptance must preserve the moving-frame kinematic summary
  equations before Rust, Go, Julia, Mojo, or Python rows can pass.
- Added explicit final-position, maximum-velocity, and path-length equation
  replay to the PHA-C moving-frame benchmark gate so kinematic summaries must
  derive from the row-major velocity schedule before acceptance passes.
- Added explicit signed-margin equation replay to the PHA-C merge-window
  benchmark gate so phase and spatial lock margins must equal tolerance minus
  dispersion before merge-window acceptance passes.
- Added explicit signed-margin equation replay to the PHA-C handoff verifier
  and polyglot benchmark gate so per-sample phase and spatial margins must
  equal tolerance minus dispersion before handoff acceptance passes.
- Added explicit signed-margin equation replay to the PHA-C event-timeline
  verifier and polyglot benchmark gate so trajectory-level phase and spatial
  margins must equal tolerance minus maximum dispersion before timeline
  acceptance passes.
- Added explicit signed-margin equation replay to the PHA-C acceptance
  verifier and polyglot benchmark gate so phase and spatial safety margins must
  equal tolerance minus maximum dispersion before acceptance passes.
- Added explicit `phase_budget_discharged` replay to
  `PHACKinematicProofObligation` and PHA-C acceptance benchmarks so Lean
  phase-budget theorem metadata must agree with the fixed-point certificate
  arithmetic.
- Added Lean `PhaseBudgetBounds` for PHA-C fixed-point phase-lock budgets,
  including theorem metadata in `PHACKinematicProofObligation`, smoke proof
  coverage, benchmark acceptance fields, and API documentation updates.
- Added explicit predictive phase-drift slack to
  `PHACKinematicProofObligation`, including fixed-point phase-budget
  provenance, fail-closed verifier checks, module-specific tests, PHA-C
  benchmark acceptance fields, and API documentation updates.
- Added explicit predictive coupling-residual slack to
  `PHACKinematicProofObligation`, including fixed-point residual-bound
  provenance, fail-closed verifier checks, module-specific tests, and PHA-C
  documentation updates.
- Added `SPOFormal.Continuous` for PHA-C fixed-point continuous-envelope
  certificates, including horizon-drive sampling, Python manifest fields,
  benchmark row propagation, proof-gate integration, and API documentation.
- Added sampled continuous-rate evidence to the PHA-C runtime-to-Lean
  kinematic proof bridge, including fixed-point time-step fields,
  per-second velocity and residual rate bounds, Lean
  `SampledRateKinematicBounds` smoke proofs, benchmark acceptance fields,
  module-specific tests, API docs, README, roadmap, and performance-guide
  updates.
- Generalised the PHA-C runtime-to-Lean kinematic proof bridge from the
  zero-gain replay certificate to the finite-horizon Gronwall
  `budget_certificate_discharges_budget` theorem, including non-zero
  Lipschitz-gain manifest fields, trace hashing, Lean smoke proofs,
  benchmark acceptance fields, module-specific tests, API docs, README, and
  performance-guide updates.
- Added `PHACKinematicProofObligation` as the runtime-to-Lean PHA-C formal
  bridge, including fixed-point `KinematicBounds` manifest hashing, lazy UPDE
  exports, Lean `zeroGainCertificate` theorem discharge, benchmark acceptance
  fields, module-specific tests, API docs, roadmap, README, and benchmark
  snapshot integration.
- Added signed PHA-C moving-frame kinematic residual evidence across
  `MovingFrameUPDEEngine`, `moving_frame_run(...)`, the end-to-end acceptance
  record, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo source-contract validation, benchmark thresholds,
  module-specific tests, API docs, roadmap, README, and benchmark snapshots.
- Added signed PHA-C merge-window safety margins across `MergeReport`,
  handoff, event timeline, and end-to-end acceptance records, with replay
  verifiers, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo source-contract parity checks, benchmark
  acceptance fields, module-specific tests, API docs, roadmap, and README
  updates.
- Added PHA-C hash-replay verifiers for handoff, event-timeline, and
  end-to-end acceptance records, wired them through the Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo
  source-contract validation helpers, benchmark acceptance thresholds, module
  tests, public API exports, and documentation.
- Added explicit source-contract versus native-kernel provenance to PHA-C
  handoff, timeline, and acceptance benchmark records so Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo
  adapters cannot be mistaken for native execution until reviewed kernels land.
- Added a PHA-C end-to-end acceptance gate that spans spatial modulation,
  Doppler correction, moving-frame propagation, merge-window timeline
  conversion, deterministic schedule/trajectory/hash evidence, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo
  source-contract parity adapters, aggregate PHA-C subgate benchmark evidence,
  module-specific tests, public API documentation, and a dedicated
  local-regression benchmark snapshot with canonical reference-suite inclusion.
- Added PHA-C event timeline records that consume moving-frame phase/position
  trajectories through the handoff contract, report first lock, lock losses,
  reset counts, tolerance-profile provenance, deterministic trajectory hashes,
  Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo source-contract parity adapters, module-specific tests,
  public API documentation, and a dedicated local-regression benchmark snapshot.
- Added PHA-C event/state handoff records that bind moving-frame phase/position
  samples to merge-window lock evidence, Kuramoto order-parameter evidence,
  source-chain hashes, a fixed non-actuating claim boundary, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo
  source-contract parity adapters, module-specific tests, public API
  documentation, and a dedicated local-regression benchmark snapshot.
- Added PHA-C merge-window tolerance profiles for the reviewed 1x baseline,
  3x buffer, and 5x review envelopes, including handoff provenance, Rust source
  coverage, module-specific tests, benchmark gates, and public API
  documentation.
- Added PHA-C.4 `MergeWindowMonitor` support for joint wrapped-phase and axial
  spatial merge detection, including consecutive-sample lock evidence,
  Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo source-contract surfaces, module-specific tests, public
  API documentation, and a polyglot benchmark gate.
- Added PHA-C.6 Lean 4 kinematic safety templates for finite-horizon
  fixed-point relative-distance bounds, including a discrete Gronwall-style
  budget proof, zero-gain merge-window invariant, Boolean phase-plus-spatial
  lock mirror, smoke instantiation, proof-gate integration, and public
  documentation.

### Security

- Raised the FastAPI/Starlette deployment floor so QueueWaves-style services
  require Starlette `>=1.0.1`, which includes the Host-header validation fix
  for GHSA-86qp-5c8j-p5mr.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Added PHA-C.3 `MovingFrameUPDEEngine` support for joint phase and axial-position UPDE runs, including distance-modulated coupling, Doppler-corrected moving-frame schedules, collision/crossing predicates, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo source surfaces, module-specific merger coverage, and a polyglot benchmark gate.
- Added PHA-C.2 `DopplerEngine` support for velocity-corrected UPDE runs, including scalar/vector velocity handling, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo schedule source surfaces, module-specific tests, Mach-1 counter-propagating lock coverage, and a polyglot benchmark gate.
- Added PHA-C.5 time-varying `omega(t)` support for `UPDEEngine`, including configured fixed or callable frequencies, schedule-resolved backend dispatch, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo schedule entry points, module-specific tests, and a polyglot benchmark gate.
- Added `SpatialCouplingModulator` and `spatial_modulate` as the PHA-C.1 spatial coupling surface, including Euclidean distance kernels, analytic Jacobians, Rust/Go/Julia/Mojo adapter contracts, and a polyglot benchmark gate.

- Added Lyapunov/STL/safety-cost constrained replay acceptance for
  RL/autotune policy proposals, including audit serialisation, learner-wrapper
  forwarding, reference-suite gates, and public API documentation.
- Added deterministic formal runtime-control certificates that bind package
  hashes, checker readiness, reviewed checker results, and finite runtime
  bounds into non-actuating fail-closed audit records.
- Added a fractal-dimension polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python full-pairs correlation-integral parity,
  monotonicity, unit-interval bounds, and Kaplan-Yorke parity in the
  reference-suite snapshot.
- Added Strogatz/Acebrón Kuramoto reference acceptance fields for bounded
  coherence, zero self-coupling, and the exact two-oscillator locked phase-lag
  law in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added Stuart-Landau/Pikovsky reference acceptance fields for Hopf
  limit-cycle radius convergence, subcritical amplitude decay, zero
  self-coupling, and wrapped phase-domain evidence in the reference-suite
  snapshot.
- Added Petri-net reference acceptance fields for exact four-marking
  reachability, one-token conservation, deterministic transition order, and
  expected final marking evidence in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added a Lyapunov spectrum polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python status, timing, and numerical parity against the
  Python reference in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added an NPE polyglot benchmark gate that records Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python
  status, circular-distance parity, scalar persistent-entropy parity, and
  unavailable-toolchain reasons in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added an ITPC polyglot benchmark gate that records Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python
  status, inter-trial phase-coherence vector parity, pause-persistence parity,
  aligned-trial unit coherence, and opposite-phase zero coherence in the
  reference-suite snapshot.
- Added a chimera polyglot benchmark gate that records Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python
  status, Kuramoto-Battogtokh local-order parity, global phase-gauge
  invariance, synchronised unit local order, disconnected zero local order, and
  the exact uniform-circle all-to-all reference in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added a spectral graph polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python algebraic-connectivity parity, Fiedler-vector
  direction parity, non-negative spectral gap, Laplacian row-sum and
  positive-semidefinite contracts, and exact uniform-path plus complete-graph
  spectra in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added a Hodge decomposition polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python gradient, curl, and harmonic parity, reconstruction
  error, harmonic-residual bounds, global phase-shift invariance,
  symmetric/antisymmetric special cases, two-node antisymmetric closed-form
  evidence, scale covariance, and local non-isolated benchmark evidence labels.
- Added a Takens delay-embedding polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python delay-indexing parity, standalone mutual
  information and nearest-neighbour primitive parity where exposed, public
  dispatch parity, constant-signal mutual-information zero contracts,
  zero-lag information dominance, time-shift row consistency, and
  nearest-neighbour self-exclusion evidence.
- Added a transfer-entropy polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python exact histogram-estimator scalar and matrix parity,
  causal-direction preservation, scalar-matrix consistency, zero-diagonal
  matrix structure, entropy bounds, phase-wrapping invariance, public dispatch
  parity, and local non-isolated benchmark evidence labels.
- Added an entropy-production polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python exact overdamped-Kuramoto dissipation parity,
  non-negative rate contracts, fixed-point and zero-timestep limits, linear
  timestep scaling, quadratic coupling-scalar scaling, phase-shift invariance,
  permutation invariance, public dispatch parity, and local non-isolated
  benchmark evidence labels.
- Added an order-parameter polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python parity for Kuramoto `R`, mean phase, PLV, and layer
  coherence in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added a recurrence polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python exact threshold parity for recurrence,
  cross-recurrence, self-cross identity, and bounded RQA reference statistics
  in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added a winding-number polyglot benchmark gate that records
  Rust/Mojo/Julia/Go/Python exact integer parity against the wrapped-increment
  topological reference in the reference-suite snapshot.
- Added the `julia` optional dependency extra and wired `juliacall` into the
  `dev` and `full` dependency sets so installed Julia runtimes resolve through
  the Python bridge for polyglot benchmark gates.

### Changed

- Polished the README, documentation home page, onboarding path, use-case
  guide, notebook/demo inventory, and API reference routing so new readers can
  understand the product purpose, evaluation order, market applications, and
  evidence boundaries before entering the full API tree.
- Bumped package metadata and regenerated the public capability inventory for
  the release-preparation pass.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Polished the public README, documentation home page, onboarding route, and
  Python facade API reference with clearer use-case, operator-value,
  evidence-boundary, release-posture, and reader-routing guidance.
- Added an executive overview page for buyer, operator, and technical
  evaluation paths across domainpacks, dynamics, supervision, evidence, and
  frontier tracks.
- Bumped release metadata and regenerated the public capability inventory for
  the release-preparation pass.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Expanded the public documentation spine with clearer product-value framing,
  use-case qualification criteria, API-by-reader routing, and notebook-to-
  production evidence boundaries.
- Removed obsolete tracked planning artefacts from the public documentation
  surface; internal planning records now remain under ignored internal paths
  only.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added a release-orientation documentation spine covering use cases, market
  value, onboarding routes, tutorial selection, notebook production paths, and
  API-by-job navigation.
- Added JAX-backed information-geometry and multiverse rollout paths, expanded
  multiverse scenario coverage, added strange-loop drift scenario gates, and
  added review-only sheaf obstruction control proposals with deterministic
  evidence surfaces.
- Added public Studio facade exports for the integrated-information,
  strange-loop, and morphogenetic-field passive review panels.
- Added passive Studio surfacing for multiverse counterfactual rollout
  manifests and branch-risk reports.

  contracts plus passive Studio surfacing for hybrid classical-quantum
  entanglement order-parameter evidence.
- Added passive Studio surfacing for information-geometry control proposal
  audit records and deterministic domain scenario evidence.
- Added passive Studio surfacing for Topos semantic-binding validation reports
  and deterministic domain obligation examples.
- Added passive Studio surfacing for evolutionary supervisor policy-search
  reports, enriched domain examples, and policy-DSL mutation evidence.
- Added a standalone Studio product manifest that registers passive physics
  review panels, carries a deterministic manifest hash, and exposes them to the
  packaged Streamlit shell without enabling execution, transport, hardware, or
  actuation paths.
- Added explicit Pareto objective constraints to the value-alignment supervisor
  guard, including fail-closed missing-objective evidence, counterfactual
  Pareto violation audit records, and fallback preservation.
- Added a lightweight Python API layer with `Orchestrator.from_yaml(...)` and
  `Orchestrator.run(...)`, plus the `scpn` import alias for onboarding scripts
  that should not depend on CLI invocation.
- Added a real-data review demo for PhysioNet heart-rate-belt data through
  `spo demo --dataset heartbeat.csv --target coherence --steps N`, including
  dataset citation output, review-only auto-binding, and dashboard guidance.

### Changed

- Changed runtime request limiting from fixed minute windows to token-bucket
  semantics so callers cannot consume a full per-minute allowance in a single
  burst without bucket capacity.
- Made action-projector slew limits binding-configurable through
  `actuators[].rate_limit_per_step` while preserving conservative defaults for
  omitted binding metadata.
- Documented Modbus/TLS as requiring server certificate verification for both
  deployment CA bundles and the operating-system trust store path.

### Fixed

- Hardened UPDE, Hodge decomposition, E/I balance, chimera, Lyapunov,
  plasticity, coupling-lag, K_nm geometry, spectral-coupling, SSGF, NPE,
  ITPC, embedding, order-parameter, swarmalator, splitting, simplicial,
  reduction, PAC, and market numerical boundaries around real-valued inputs,
  zero self-coupling, exact backend-output preservation, typed direct
  Go/Julia/Mojo validation, and object-dtype complex alias rejection.
- Hardened auto-binding YAML generation by emitting structured YAML instead of
  interpolating raw source column names into text.
- Hardened symbolic binding compilation with intent sanitisation, schema
  validation, and explicit review-gate metadata before any generated binding is
  treated as operational evidence.
- Hardened demo domainpack loading against path traversal outside
  `domainpacks/`.
- Seeded audit hash chains with the header record content so replay integrity
  includes the stream header.
- Hardened QueueWaves WebSocket ingress to accept only keepalive messages from
  clients and reject arbitrary inbound payloads.
- Hardened Petri-net guard evaluation by rejecting unknown guard context keys
  and non-finite guard values before transition evaluation.
- Hardened bifurcation continuation and critical-coupling fast paths by
  rejecting non-zero self-coupling diagonals, invalid composite Rust
  `R(K)` arrays, and invalid Rust `K_c` results.
- Hardened typed-array maintenance by replacing residual runtime-only
  `np.ndarray` annotations in monitor and direct accelerator validation helpers
  with parameterised NumPy payload aliases, and strengthened the source hygiene
  test to block regressions.
- Hardened multiverse counterfactual rollouts by rejecting object-dtype boolean
  and complex aliases before phase, frequency, coupling, phase-lag, or topology
  mask payloads are accepted for non-actuating branch simulation.
- Hardened information-geometry control proposals by rejecting complex
  distribution and gradient aliases before simplex normalisation or
  natural-gradient proposal generation.
- Hardened value-alignment policy boundaries by rejecting NumPy boolean
  aliases in direct constraint, score-threshold, and Pareto objective scalars.
- Hardened information-geometry scenario fixtures by rejecting complex
  distribution and record-gradient aliases before deterministic audit hashing.
- Hardened multiverse domain scenario fixtures by rejecting boolean and complex
  phase, frequency, and branch-knob aliases before deterministic review hashing.
- Hardened the FusionCore bridge boundary by rejecting non-positive q-profile
  bounds, negative fusion observables, negative stability ratios, and empty
  phase-feedback vectors before phase encoding or order-parameter export.
- Hardened the SCPNControl bridge boundary by rejecting empty, boolean-alias,
  complex-alias, and non-zero self-coupled `K_nm` imports plus empty or
  non-real natural-frequency imports before orchestration state conversion.
- Hardened the SNN controller bridge by bounding UPDE order-parameter
  magnitudes, rejecting negative spike rates, and rejecting boolean or complex
  aliases before LIF current, rate, and neuromorphic schedule conversion.
- Hardened the Neurocore bridge by rejecting negative deterministic seeds and
  boolean-alias rate vectors before action projection or Rust backend output
  acceptance.
- Hardened the LSL BCI bridge by rejecting boolean EEG samples and malformed
  sample timestamps before buffered Hilbert phase extraction.
- Hardened the hardware I/O boundary by rejecting boolean and complex
  sample/frequency aliases before buffering or synthetic EEG generation.
- Hardened the Prometheus adapter decoded sample-pair boundary by rejecting
  boolean, negative, and non-real sample timestamps before returning range or
  instant metric values.
- Closed the named Gaian/Prometheus JSON deserialisation roadmap scope and
  moved future adjacent JSON reviews into public boundary maintenance.
- Expanded the artifacts API reference with QPU data artifact schema, safety,
  hash, JSON, failure-mode, and file I/O contracts plus a dedicated docs guard.
- Expanded the scaffold API reference with review-only proposal, provider,
  validation, audit-record, CLI, and operator-review contracts plus a dedicated
  docs guard.
- Expanded the Python facade API reference with import, binding-validation,
  deterministic-run, state-record, and safety-boundary contracts plus a
  dedicated docs guard.
- Expanded the distributed sync API reference with phase-gossip wire-message,
  digest, sequence-watermark, bounded-correction, replay, and audit contracts
  plus a dedicated docs guard.
- Expanded the coupling inference API reference with transfer-entropy,
  orientation, thresholding, backend-failure, audit-record, CLI, and
  review-boundary contracts plus a dedicated docs guard.
- Expanded the visualization API reference with JSON-encoder, streamer,
  validation, deterministic-rounding, pipeline-wiring, typed-array, and
  presentation-boundary contracts plus a dedicated docs guard.
- Expanded the Poincare monitor API reference with recurrence, result-record,
  backend-validation, accelerator-parity, fallback, sample-time, and
  observational-boundary contracts plus a dedicated docs guard.
- Aligned Gaian mesh peer and local phase validation with circular phase
  semantics by wrapping finite negative `psi` values modulo `2*pi`.
- Hardened the PlasmaControl bridge boundary by rejecting boolean numeric
  aliases, non-zero layer self-coupling, empty phase snapshots, negative plasma
  ratios, and non-positive safety-factor minima before coupling expansion or
  phase-state export.
- Aligned the Python Lyapunov reference QR routine with the Rust/Go/Mojo
  two-pass modified Gram-Schmidt tangent-basis contract so finite-horizon
  spectra remain reproducible across built backend artifacts.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- Removed generic coverage, integration, smoke, and fallback catch-all test
  files in favour of dedicated module-owned test surfaces and lowered the
  coverage gate to 60% while the suite is rebuilt around per-module production
  tests.
- Rebuilt physics and mathematics regression coverage around module-specific
  behavioural contracts for UPDE, Stuart-Landau, splitting, Hodge, plasticity,
  coupling lags, K_nm geometry, spectral coupling, E/I balance, universal
  priors, causal coupling inference, and bifurcation interpolation.

### Fixed

- Hardened numerical boundary validation for phase-domain outputs, zero
  self-coupling diagonals, finite coherence/order-parameter calculations,
  boolean numeric aliases, prior hyperparameters, and transfer-entropy coupling
  inference scalar configuration.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added the plugin execution lifecycle stack: deterministic planning,
  approval, request, revocation, revocation-list, storage-bundle,
  storage-adapter, lifecycle-status, lifecycle-summary, and
  lifecycle-policy-report artefacts with CLI surfaces, hash validation,
  fail-closed revocation handling, and operator action queues.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added deterministic time-series discovery evidence for auto-binding
  proposals, including regular time-column sample-rate inference,
  sparse-derivative regression summaries, phase-aware Kuramoto SINDy evidence,
  residual-scored SINDy library selection, correlation graph edges, lagged
  directed graph inference, clustering evidence, CLI zero-config support,
  tests, and documentation.
- Added review-only extractor-parameter proposals and an `auto_initial_k`
  binding template for time-series auto-binding, including per-family source
  statistics, validator-accepted `cross_channel_couplings`, audit provenance,
  CLI JSON exposure, tests, and documentation.
- Added synthetic reference-suite benchmark coverage for auto-binding proposal
  quality, measuring extractor coverage, validator acceptance, expected
  initial-K support recall, generated edge count, and wall-clock throughput in
  the dated benchmark snapshot.
- Added crate-owned Kani formal safety harnesses and function contracts for
  supervisor action projection and regime classification invariants.
- Added an adaptive fixed-point rate-limit contract for certifiable actuator
  envelopes, including exact integer projection helpers and Rust regression
  tests.
- Added a WebGPU UPDE backend package generator with WGSL compute shader,
  browser ES-module runner, dispatcher registration, tests, and documentation.
- Added a protobuf-backed audit event stream with hash-chained envelopes,
  `spo watch` live replay, tests, and documentation.
- Added `auto-coupling-estimation` for transfer-entropy causal discovery of
  directed coupling matrices from phase time-series data, with CLI, audit
  records, tests, and API documentation.
- Added Bayesian UPDE uncertainty propagation over sampled `omega` and `K_nm`
  distributions, reporting posterior-predictive `R ± sigma`, credible
  intervals, audit records, tests, and API documentation.
- Added fail-closed LLM-guided domainpack scaffolding through
  `spo scaffold --llm`, including strict JSON proposal validation,
  deterministic binding YAML generation, audit records, tests, and
  documentation.
- Added a transport-neutral distributed phase synchronisation protocol for
  UPDE nodes, with canonical wire messages, digest checks, sequence
  watermarks, bounded circular phase correction, deterministic lossy-gossip
  replay, tests, and API documentation.
### Changed

- Updated the public documentation inventory and contributor documentation
  duties to reflect the current API-page, example, and module-docstring
  coverage state.
- Replaced external Kani proof stubs with `spo-supervisor` harnesses that call
  the same Rust functions used at runtime, and made the Kani workflow fail on
  proof failures.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added SPO Studio operator workflow surfaces for deployment commands,
  readiness checks, connector planning, canvas review, topology patch export,
  package materialisation, and beginner walkthroughs.
- Added hierarchy, digital-twin, STL policy, morphogenetic-field, sheaf
  obstruction, integrated-information, network-security, biology, and
  domain-value alignment manifests and demonstrations.
- Added value guards across active domainpacks and demo surfaces so generated
  scenarios carry explicit domain, safety, and output-shape expectations.

### Changed

- Bumped release and development tooling pins for CodeQL, Ruff, maturin, mypy,
  build, twine, and related publish locks.
- Tightened public documentation hygiene by removing internal planning files
  from the published documentation surface.

### Fixed

- Bounded reported coherence/order-parameter magnitudes to the physical
  interval `[0, 1]`, eliminating floating-point roundoff leakage above unity.
- Hardened runtime validation across Kuramoto, UPDE, monitor, topology,
  FEP hierarchy, causal rollout, Petri, policy, supervisor, and domainpack
  configuration surfaces.
- Stabilised CI, benchmark, cargo-audit, pre-push, type-check, and publish
  gates, including idempotent cargo-audit installation.
- Raised the `urllib3` security floor and refreshed lockfiles for current
  advisory compliance.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Moved the Linux ARM Rust wheel build to GitHub's native
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner so maturin executes the ARM manylinux CPython 3.12
  interpreter instead of failing with an x86 `Exec format error`.
- Moved the release container to the pinned Python 3.13 slim digest so the
  runtime image no longer carries the Python 3.12 HIGH finding reported by
  Grype.
- Tightened container scanner policy so Trivy and Grype still scan all layers
  while failing releases only on fixable HIGH or CRITICAL findings.

### Added

- Extended release-workflow hygiene tests to guard the native Linux ARM runner
  selection, the Python 3.13 container base-image digest, and fixable
  vulnerability scanner gates.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Forced Linux manylinux Rust wheel builds to use the explicit CPython 3.12
  interpreter path provided by the PyPA manylinux images, avoiding maturin's
  ambiguous default `python3` discovery path.
- Refreshed stale pinned Docker base-image digests for the release container
  build after the previous Rust image digest stopped resolving from Docker Hub,
  then aligned the FFI builder with the runtime CPython 3.12 image while
  installing the stable Rust 1.95 toolchain inside that builder.

### Added

- Added release-workflow regression tests for Linux maturin interpreter
  selection and container base-image digest pins.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Aligned PyPI publish preflight test scope with the protected CI Python matrix
  so tag-triggered releases do not run the CPU-JAX physics-validation suite that
  is intentionally excluded from the standard CI path.
- Replaced invalid pinned publish-workflow action refs for `PyO3/maturin-action`,
  `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`, and `aquasecurity/trivy-action` with
  resolvable commit pins.
- Added `tools/check_github_action_refs.py` and tests so release preflight fails
  before artifact fan-out when a pinned GitHub Action ref cannot be resolved.
- Moved release metadata from the setup-failed `v0.5.7` publish attempt to
  `0.5.8`; the `v0.5.7` run passed preflight and built pure-Python artifacts,
  but failed before PyPI upload because multiple pinned action refs were invalid.
- Moved release metadata from the timed-out `v0.5.6` publish attempt to
  `0.5.8`; the `v0.5.6` run timed out before artifact build or PyPI publish.
- Added a bounded, verbose PyPI publish preflight test step so release runs
  fail with actionable diagnostics instead of hanging indefinitely during
  full-suite pytest execution.
- Moved release metadata from the canceled `v0.5.5` publish attempt to
  `0.5.6`; the `v0.5.5` run was canceled before artifact build or PyPI publish.
- Added `tools/check_release_tag_version.py` and focused tests so tag-triggered
  release workflows fail early when `GITHUB_REF_NAME` does not match the Python
  package version in `pyproject.toml`.
- Regenerated `requirements/publish-tools.txt` from
  `requirements/publish-tools.in` as a complete hashed lock for `build`,
  `twine`, and their runtime dependencies; the PyPI publish workflow no longer
  installs these tools with `--no-deps`.
- Added publish workflow and publish lock paths to the ClusterFuzzLite path
  filter so required `python-fuzz` checks run on release-infrastructure PRs.
- Documented why publish tooling must include dependency graphs for isolated
  artifact builds and `twine check`.

### Added (2026-04-18 — coupling.spectral multi-backend)
- `julia/spectral.jl`, `go/spectral.go` (→ `libspectral.so`),
  `mojo/spectral.mojo` (→ `spectral_mojo`) implementing the
  symmetric eigendecomposition of the combinatorial graph
  Laplacian ``L = D − |W|`` (Dörfler-Bullo 2014, 2013).
- Python bridges `coupling/_spectral_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `coupling/spectral.py` upgraded to a five-backend dispatcher
  on the ``spectral_eig(W, n) → (eigvals, fiedler)`` primitive.
  Rust retains its five pre-existing per-function FFI fast paths
  (``fiedler_value``, ``fiedler_vector``, ``spectral_gap``,
  ``critical_coupling``, ``sync_convergence_rate``); Julia, Go,
  Mojo, Python route through the shared primitive.
- Julia uses ``LinearAlgebra.eigen(Symmetric(L))`` (LAPACK
  ``dsyev``). Go uses ``gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat.EigenSym`` —
  pure-Go symmetric solver, no LAPACK. Mojo calls LAPACK
  ``dsyev_`` via the ``std.ffi.OwnedDLHandle`` pattern unlocked
  in commit ``6be6f9e``. Explicit symmetrisation
  (``0.5 (L + Lᵀ)``) in Julia/Go/Mojo guards against
  floating-point asymmetry introduced during ``L = D − W``
  construction that would otherwise trip gonum / LAPACK's
  triangle-specific solvers.
- Python reference realigned to the same construction
  (``np.linalg.eigh`` on the explicit ``graph_laplacian``).
- 36 new tests — `tests/test_spectral_algorithm.py` (18 incl.
  Hypothesis: Laplacian row-sums, ``λ_min = 0``, complete-graph
  closed form ``K_c = Δω / N``, disconnected-graph
  ``K_c = ∞``, partition disjointness),
  `tests/test_spectral_backends.py` (14 cross-backend parity
  checking eigenvalue arrays and eigen-equation residual
  ``||L·v₂ − λ₂·v₂||`` to handle the ``±sign`` eigenvector
  ambiguity), `tests/test_spectral_stability.py` (4 long-run
  invariants — N=50 scale-up, Fiedler-1973 ``λ₂``-monotonicity
  under edge addition, disconnected-component detection,
  Anderson-Morley ``λ_max ≤ 2 d_max`` bound).
- Regression-green: pre-existing `test_spectral.py`,
  `test_prop_hodge_spectral.py`, `test_convergence_topology.py`,
  `test_roundtrip_consistency.py` — **149 existing tests still
  pass**.
- Parity: eigenvalues agree to ``~1e-12`` across LAPACK-based
  backends (Rust, Julia, Mojo, Python) and ``~1e-11`` for
  Go's ``gonum.EigenSym`` — tight enough for all consumers
  (``ssgf.costs`` and ``ssgf.ethical`` both consume
  ``fiedler_value`` scalar outputs).
- `benchmarks/spectral_benchmark.py` — per-backend wall-clock
  harness at ``N ∈ {16, 64, 128}``. Measured numbers show Go
  winning at ``N=128`` (78 ms vs Julia 159 ms vs Rust 198 ms
  vs Python 597 ms vs Mojo 1099 ms) — ``gonum.EigenSym``'s
  pure-Go implementation outperforms LAPACK's divide-and-conquer
  path for medium-sized dense Laplacians; Julia leads at
  ``N=64``; Rust carries real per-call overhead from the
  Laplacian allocator on small problems. Canonical
  Rust → Mojo → Julia → Go → Python ordering retained per
  ``feedback_fallback_chain_ordering.md``.

### Added (2026-04-18 — market multi-backend)
- `julia/market.jl`, `go/market.go` (→ `libmarket.so`),
  `mojo/market.mojo` (→ `market_mojo`) implementing two
  financial-Kuramoto compute kernels:
  * ``market_order_parameter(phases, T, N) → R[T]`` — per-row
    Kuramoto order parameter, ``O(T · N)``.
  * ``market_plv(phases, T, N, window) → PLV[n_windows, N, N]``
    — rolling phase-locking-value matrix with a sincos
    precompute that eliminates trig from the inner loop,
    ``O((T − W + 1) · N² · W)``.
- Python bridges `upde/_market_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/market.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher for both
  kernels; ``extract_phase`` (scipy ``hilbert``) stays Python-
  side because the compiled backends do not ship an FFT;
  ``detect_regimes`` and ``sync_warning`` remain ``O(T)``
  masking / comparison operations.
- 33 new tests — `tests/test_market_algorithm.py` (18 incl.
  Hypothesis: locked-ensemble ``R ≈ 1``, uniform-ensemble
  ``R ≈ 0``, PLV diagonal == 1, PLV bounds, regime
  classification, crossing detection, Hilbert shape invariants),
  `tests/test_market_backends.py` (10 cross-backend parity for
  both kernels with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go),
  `tests/test_market_stability.py` (5 long-run invariants:
  bounds over T=5000, PLV symmetry, locked subpopulation
  staying near PLV = 1, empty-input edge case).
- Parity measured at ``~1e-15`` tolerance — identity-level drift
  between the native-backend sincos form and the Python
  reference's ``|np.mean(exp(iθ))|``; mathematically identical
  but with different rounding accumulation.
- Regression-green: pre-existing ``test_market.py`` (18 tests)
  still passes.
- `benchmarks/market_benchmark.py` — per-backend wall-clock
  harness for both kernels. Rust leads at production sizes
  (PLV at ``T=500, N=16, W=50``: 16.76 ms Rust vs 24.75 ms
  Julia vs 36.43 ms Go vs 30.45 ms Python). Go wins only on
  the small ``T=100, N=8, W=20`` PLV problem where the rayon
  fork-join overhead dominates.

### Changed (2026-04-18 — bifurcation DRY refactor)
- `upde/bifurcation.py` now delegates its single-trial Kuramoto
  integrator to :func:`basin_stability.steady_state_r` instead
  of carrying a local duplicate. The Python-composite branch of
  ``trace_sync_transition`` / ``find_critical_coupling``
  therefore inherits the full 5-backend dispatcher (Rust / Mojo
  / Julia / Go / Python) automatically.
- The two composite Rust fast paths
  (``trace_sync_transition_rust``,
  ``find_critical_coupling_bif_rust``) are preserved: they batch
  the whole ``K``-sweep inside Rust, amortising per-``K``
  boundary overhead better than N_points × dispatch calls.
- Pre-existing ``test_bifurcation.py`` (16) still passes; added
  ``tests/test_bifurcation_dispatch.py`` (3) which forces the
  Python composite branch and verifies each per-``K`` trial
  actually routes through ``basin_stability.steady_state_r``.

### Added (2026-04-18 — geometric (torus) multi-backend)
- `julia/geometric.jl`, `go/geometric.go` (→ `libgeometric.so`),
  `mojo/geometric.mojo` (→ `geometric_mojo`) implementing the
  torus-preserving symplectic Euler integrator on
  ``T^N = (S¹)^N``. Each phase is lifted to ``z_i = exp(iθ_i)``
  and advanced by the exponential map
  ``z_i → z_i·exp(i·ω_eff_i·dt)``, eliminating the ``mod 2π``
  discontinuity artefacts of standard integrators.
- Python bridges `upde/_geometric_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/geometric.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher on
  the composite ``run(phases, omegas, knm, ζ, ψ, α, n_steps)``
  kernel. Python reference realigned to the Rust kernel's
  sincos expansion (``sin(θ_j − θ_i) = z_im[j]·z_re[i] −
  z_re[j]·z_im[i]``) and keeps ``(z_re, z_im)`` state between
  steps (no per-step atan2 round-trip).
- 25 new tests — `tests/test_geometric_algorithm.py` (12 incl.
  Hypothesis, zero-coupling pure rotation, zero-everywhere
  fixed point, ζ-forcing linearisation, torus preservation),
  `tests/test_geometric_backends.py` (9 cross-backend parity
  for α=0 / α≠0 regimes with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go),
  `tests/test_geometric_stability.py` (4 long-run invariants).
- Regression-green: pre-existing ``test_torus_engine.py``,
  ``test_torus_engine_deep.py``, ``test_engine_parity.py``,
  ``test_coverage_sprint2_4.py``, ``test_pipeline_wiring_audit.py``,
  ``test_upde_math.py`` — 112 tests still pass. A private
  ``_derivative`` helper is retained on ``TorusEngine`` for the
  inspection tests in ``test_torus_engine_deep``.
- Parity: bit-exact 0.0 across Rust / Julia / Go / Python on
  the α=0 branch; ≈1e-15 on the α≠0 branch (atan2 per-step
  reconstruction). Mojo ≤ 9e-16.
- `benchmarks/geometric_benchmark.py` — per-backend wall-clock
  harness at ``N ∈ {8, 32, 128}``. Go / Julia outperform Rust
  for N ≥ 32 (same rayon fork-join finding as hypergraph and
  simplicial); at N=128 Julia leads at 1.69 ms vs Rust 2.99 ms.
  Canonical Rust → Mojo → Julia → Go → Python ordering
  retained per ``feedback_fallback_chain_ordering.md``.

### Added (2026-04-18 — reduction (Ott-Antonsen) multi-backend)
- `julia/reduction.jl`, `go/reduction.go` (→ `libreduction.so`),
  `mojo/reduction.mojo` (→ `reduction_mojo`) implementing the
  Ott-Antonsen mean-field RK4 integrator for the complex-scalar
  ODE ``dz/dt = −(Δ + iω₀)·z + (K/2)·(z − |z|²·z)``
  (Ott & Antonsen 2008, *Chaos* 18(3):037113).
- Python bridges `upde/_reduction_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/reduction.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher on the
  composite ``run(z0, n_steps)`` kernel via ``_run_scalar``.
  Python reference realigned to the Rust operation order
  (``half_k = K/2`` factoring + explicit real/imaginary
  decomposition of the cubic term) for bit-exact parity.
- The scalar-output helpers ``K_c``, ``steady_state_R``, and
  ``predict_from_oscillators`` stay Python + optional Rust —
  O(1) arithmetic and O(N) percentile work do not benefit from
  multi-language chains.
- 26 new tests — `tests/test_reduction_algorithm.py` (14 incl.
  Hypothesis: constructor validation, ``K_c = 2Δ`` analytic
  relation, ``R_ss = √(1 − 2Δ/K)`` above criticality, zero
  below, trajectory convergence check, z=0 fixed point,
  Lorentzian fit from samples), `tests/test_reduction_backends.py`
  (8 cross-backend parity incl. subcritical + Hypothesis sweeps
  for Rust / Go), `tests/test_reduction_stability.py` (4
  long-run invariants: unit-disc invariance, subcritical
  attraction, supercritical convergence, monotone radius
  decay below criticality).
- Parity measured bit-exact (0.0) across Rust / Julia / Go /
  Python after 500 RK4 steps; Mojo ≤ 1.1e-16.
- Regression check: pre-existing test_ott_antonsen.py (12),
  test_upde_engine_validation.py (19), test_upde_math.py (25),
  test_stress_scale.py (10) — 66 tests still pass.
- `benchmarks/reduction_benchmark.py` — per-backend wall-clock
  harness at ``n_steps ∈ {500, 5000, 50000}``. Rust leads at
  every size (1.82 ms vs Julia 1.92 ms vs Go 1.86 ms for
  50k steps — the native compiled backends cluster within 6 %
  of each other, Python is 27× slower, Mojo's subprocess
  overhead dominates small workloads).

### Added (2026-04-18 — splitting multi-backend)
- `julia/splitting.jl`, `go/splitting.go` (→ `libsplitting.so`),
  `mojo/splitting.mojo` (→ `splitting_mojo`) implementing the
  Strang second-order operator splitting integrator
  (Hairer-Lubich-Wanner 2006, *Geometric Numerical Integration*
  §II.5). Scheme: A(dt/2) → B(dt) → A(dt/2) with A = exact
  rotation by ω and B = RK4 on the coupling-only derivative.
- Python bridges `upde/_splitting_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/splitting.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher on the
  composite ``run(phases, omegas, knm, ζ, ψ, α, n_steps)``
  kernel. Python reference realigned to the Rust sincos
  expansion (plus the ``ζ·sin(ψ−θ) = ζ·sin(ψ)·cos(θ) −
  ζ·cos(ψ)·sin(θ)`` identity) for bit-exact parity.
- 25 new tests — `tests/test_splitting_algorithm.py` (13 incl.
  Hypothesis: constructor validation, K=0 exact-rotation
  collapse, zero-coupling-zero-drive fixed point, ζ-forcing
  linearisation, run-matches-stepped composition),
  `tests/test_splitting_backends.py` (9 cross-backend parity
  for alpha=0 / alpha≠0 regimes with Hypothesis sweeps for
  Rust / Go), `tests/test_splitting_stability.py` (4 long-run
  invariants including the Strang promise that the pure-ω
  direction carries **zero truncation error**, verified over
  1000 Euler steps).
- Constructor now accepts negative ``dt`` so the pre-existing
  symplectic-reversibility test in ``test_splitting.py``
  continues to work: Strang is time-reversible, and negative
  ``dt`` falls through to the Python reference because the
  Rust/Julia/Go/Mojo kernels all validate ``dt > 0``.
- Parity measured bit-exact (0.0) across Rust / Julia / Go /
  Python under {alpha=0, alpha≠0} × {ζ=0, ζ>0}; Mojo ≤ 2.8e-17.
- `benchmarks/splitting_benchmark.py` rewritten as a per-backend
  wall-clock harness at ``N ∈ {8, 32, 128}``. Rust outperforms
  every other backend at all sizes (0.07 ms at N=8, 5.72 ms at
  N=128) because the splitting kernel is sequential — no
  ``par_iter_mut`` thread-pool overhead, unlike the hypergraph
  and simplicial kernels.

### Added (2026-04-18 — simplicial multi-backend)
- `julia/simplicial.jl`, `go/simplicial.go`
  (→ `libsimplicial.so`), `mojo/simplicial.mojo`
  (→ `simplicial_mojo`) implementing pairwise + 3-body
  all-to-all simplicial Kuramoto (Gambuzza et al. 2023,
  Tang et al. 2025) using the closed-form
  ``Σ_{j,k} sin(θ_j + θ_k − 2θ_i) = 2 · S_i · C_i``
  identity with two global sin/cos sums — O(N²) total.
- Python bridges `upde/_simplicial_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/simplicial.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher
  on the ``run(phases, omegas, knm, ζ, ψ, α, n_steps)``
  composite; pairwise path uses the Rust kernel's sincos
  expansion on the alpha-zero branch for bit-exact parity.
- 29 new tests — `tests/test_simplicial_algorithm.py` (14
  incl. Hypothesis: constructor validation, σ₂=0 Kuramoto
  limit, brute-force ``2·S_i·C_i`` identity check on N=4,
  ζ-forcing), `tests/test_simplicial_backends.py` (11
  cross-backend parity for {alpha=0, alpha≠0, σ₂=0} regimes
  with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go),
  `tests/test_simplicial_stability.py` (4 long-run invariants).
- Parity measured bit-exact (0.0) across Rust / Julia / Go /
  Python under every combination of {alpha=0, alpha≠0} ×
  {σ₂=0, σ₂>0} × {ζ=0, ζ>0}; Mojo agrees within the
  subprocess text-round-trip epsilon.
- `benchmarks/simplicial_benchmark.py` rewritten as a
  per-backend wall-clock harness at
  ``N ∈ {8, 32, 128}``, ``σ₂=0.5``. Measured numbers mirror
  the hypergraph finding: Go / Julia outperform Rust on small
  N because rayon fork-join overhead in the Rust
  ``par_iter_mut`` path dominates the O(N²) per-step compute.
  Canonical Rust → Mojo → Julia → Go → Python ordering is
  retained per ``feedback_fallback_chain_ordering.md``.

### Added (2026-04-18 — hypergraph multi-backend)
- `julia/hypergraph.jl`, `go/hypergraph.go`
  (→ `libhypergraph.so`), `mojo/hypergraph.mojo`
  (→ `hypergraph_mojo`) implementing the generalised k-body
  Kuramoto stepper (Tanaka-Aoyagi 2011, Skardal-Arenas 2019,
  Bick et al. 2023) with an optional dense pairwise ``K`` term
  and external ``(ζ, ψ)`` drive.
- Python bridges `upde/_hypergraph_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/hypergraph.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher
  operating on the ``run(phases, omegas, n_steps, …)`` entry
  point (composite-step batching matches the Rust FFI).
- Python reference realigned to the Rust sincos expansion
  ``sin(θ_j − θ_i) = s_j·c_i − c_j·s_i`` on the ``alpha == 0``
  fast path; nonzero alpha uses the direct ``sin(diff)`` form
  in all five backends, matching Rust bit-for-bit.
- 29 new tests — `tests/test_hypergraph_algorithm.py` (13 incl.
  Hypothesis: Hyperedge API, phase wrap, zero-coupling rotation,
  pairwise-only Kuramoto limit, triadic fixed-point preservation,
  near-sync local stability, ζ-forcing),
  `tests/test_hypergraph_backends.py` (11 cross-backend parity
  for pairwise / alpha≠0 / no-pairwise regimes with Hypothesis
  sweeps for Rust / Go),
  `tests/test_hypergraph_stability.py` (5 long-run invariants).
- Parity measured bit-exact (0.0) across Rust / Julia / Go /
  Python on pairwise+triadic+4-body ICs with alpha=0,
  alpha≠0, and ζ≠0; Mojo agrees within the subprocess
  text-round-trip epsilon.
- `benchmarks/hypergraph_benchmark.py` rewritten as a per-backend
  wall-clock harness at ``N ∈ {8, 32, 64}`` with 2·N random
  triadic edges. Measured numbers show Go outperforming Rust
  for small N: the kernel's inner loop is mostly sequential
  hyperedge accumulation, so the rayon fork-join overhead in
  the Rust ``par_iter_mut`` path dominates at sub-O(10⁴) work
  per step. The canonical Rust → Mojo → Julia → Go → Python
  ordering is retained per
  ``feedback_fallback_chain_ordering.md``; the benchmark
  records what actually happens on this workload.

### Added (2026-04-18 — inertial multi-backend)
- `julia/inertial.jl`, `go/inertial.go` (→ `libinertial.so`),
  `mojo/inertial.mojo` (→ `inertial_mojo`) implementing the
  second-order (swing-equation) Kuramoto RK4 stepper
  (Filatrella-Nielsen-Mallick 2008).
- Python bridges `upde/_inertial_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/inertial.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher. The
  Python reference was realigned to use the same
  ``sin(θ_j − θ_i) = sin(θ_j)·cos(θ_i) − cos(θ_j)·sin(θ_i)``
  expansion as the Rust kernel (``spo-engine/src/inertial.rs``),
  giving bit-exact parity across Rust / Julia / Go / Python. Mojo
  drifts only by the subprocess text-round-trip epsilon.
- 21 new tests — `tests/test_inertial_algorithm.py` (13 incl.
  Hypothesis: RK4 exactness under zero coupling + zero damping,
  exponential ω-decay under damping, phase wrap, shapes, helpers)
  and `tests/test_inertial_backends.py` (8 cross-backend +
  multi-step parity with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go).
- Parity measured 0.0 bit-exact across Rust / Julia / Go / Python
  and 1.7e-18 on Mojo for one RK4 step on the canonical N=8
  all-to-all test problem.
- `benchmarks/inertial_benchmark.py` rewritten as a per-backend
  wall-clock harness at ``N ∈ {8, 32, 128}`` (the earlier single-
  backend stub is replaced; no historical numbers are lost since
  it printed only a single throughput figure).

### Added (2026-04-18 — basin_stability multi-backend)
- `julia/basin_stability.jl`, `go/basin_stability.go`
  (→ `libbasin_stability.so`), `mojo/basin_stability.mojo`
  (→ `basin_stability_mojo`) implementing the one-trial Kuramoto
  ``steady_state_r`` kernel (explicit Euler, transient discarded,
  time-averaged order parameter).
- Python bridges `upde/_basin_stability_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/basin_stability.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher on
  the single-trial kernel. Rust's ``steady_state_r_rust`` FFI is
  now the active path; ``basin_stability(...)`` owns the Monte
  Carlo loop + RNG in Python (``np.random.default_rng(seed)``) and
  calls the dispatched trial kernel once per IC. This is the
  ``dimension`` pattern — Python owns randomness so the compute
  primitive stays deterministic and parity-testable.
- 26 new tests — `tests/test_basin_stability_algorithm.py` (16
  algorithmic + Hypothesis incl. physics limits, threshold
  monotonicity, ``multi_basin_stability`` keys, shape / bounds /
  determinism), `tests/test_basin_stability_backends.py` (10
  cross-backend parity with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go).
- Parity measured bit-exact (0.0) across all five backends for
  the canonical all-to-all test problem.
- `benchmarks/basin_stability_benchmark.py` — per-backend
  wall-clock harness at ``N ∈ {8, 32, 64}``, ``n_transient=200``,
  ``n_measure=100``.

### Added (2026-04-18 — swarmalator multi-backend)
- `julia/swarmalator.jl`, `go/swarmalator.go`
  (→ `libswarmalator.so`), `mojo/swarmalator.mojo`
  (→ `swarmalator_mojo`) implementing the O(N²·d) swarmalator
  step (O'Keeffe & Strogatz 2017) with position attraction /
  repulsion coupled to Kuramoto-style phase dynamics.
- Python bridges `upde/_swarmalator_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/swarmalator.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
  `SwarmalatorEngine` keeps ``(n_agents, dim, dt)`` state;
  the step itself stays stateless ``(pos, phases, omegas) →
  (new_pos, new_phases)``.
- Python reference fallback re-aligned to the Rust kernel:
  repulse uses ``b / (dist · d²ₛᵤₘ + eps)`` (pre-eps squared
  sum), not the earlier ``b / (dist³ + eps)`` variant. The two
  agree as ``eps → 0`` but drift at small distances; all four
  non-Rust backends now match Rust exactly.
- 19 new tests — `tests/test_swarmalator_algorithm.py` (11
  algorithmic + Hypothesis: phase wrap invariant, translation
  invariance of velocity, coincident-agents regularisation,
  ``k = 0`` decouples phases from positions),
  `tests/test_swarmalator_backends.py` (8 cross-backend parity
  with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go).
- Parity: Rust 5.5e-17, Julia 0.0 exact, Go 2.8e-17, Mojo
  1.1e-16 (all under the 1e-9 tolerance).
- `benchmarks/swarmalator_benchmark.py` — per-backend wall-clock
  harness at ``N ∈ {8, 32, 128}``, ``dim=2``, 5 calls.

### Added (2026-04-18 — retrofitted per-backend benchmarks)
- `benchmarks/psychedelic_benchmark.py`,
  `benchmarks/hodge_benchmark.py`,
  `benchmarks/envelope_benchmark.py` — per-backend wall-clock
  harnesses for the three earlier migrations whose
  benchmark step had been skipped. Each sweeps a representative
  size range and records ``ms_per_call`` for every available
  backend.

### Added (2026-04-18 — envelope multi-backend)
- `julia/envelope.jl`, `go/envelope.go` (→ `libenvelope.so`),
  `mojo/envelope.mojo` (→ `envelope_mojo`) implementing
  sliding-window RMS (O(T) cumulative-sum form) + modulation depth.
- Python bridges `upde/_envelope_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `upde/envelope.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher on the
  1-D path. The 2-D batched ``(T, N)`` path stays pure NumPy (Rust
  FFI is 1-D-only; vectorised NumPy is already near-optimal).
- Python fallback handles the ``window > T`` edge case (all-zero
  output to match Rust canonical behaviour); parity tests restrict
  Hypothesis to the physically meaningful ``window ≤ T`` regime.
- 20 new tests — `tests/test_envelope_algorithm.py` (12 algorithmic
  + Hypothesis), `tests/test_envelope_backends.py` (8 cross-backend
  parity with Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go).
- Parity bit-equivalent (0.0 exact) on Rust / Julia / Go; 3.3e-15
  on Mojo.

### Added (2026-04-18 — hodge multi-backend)
- `julia/hodge.jl`, `go/hodge.go` (→ `libhodge.so`),
  `mojo/hodge.mojo` (→ `hodge_mojo`) implementing the Hodge
  decomposition of coupling dynamics into symmetric (gradient),
  antisymmetric (curl), and harmonic (residual) per-oscillator
  components (Jiang et al. 2011).
- Python bridges `coupling/_hodge_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `coupling/hodge.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
- 15 new tests — `tests/test_hodge_algorithm.py` (8 algorithmic +
  Hypothesis incl. symmetric-K → zero curl, antisymmetric-K → zero
  gradient, gradient+curl+harmonic reconstructs total),
  `tests/test_hodge_backends.py` (7 cross-backend parity with
  Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go).
- Parity measured bit-equivalent (4.4e-16) on Rust/Julia/Go.
  Mojo 8.9e-16.

### Added (2026-04-18 — psychedelic entropy multi-backend)
- `julia/psychedelic.jl`, `go/psychedelic.go`
  (→ `libpsychedelic.so`), `mojo/psychedelic.mojo`
  (→ `psychedelic_mojo`) implementing the circular-phase Shannon
  entropy kernel (wrap to ``[0, 2π)`` + histogram + entropy in nats).
- Python bridges `monitor/_psychedelic_{julia,go,mojo}.py`.
- `monitor/psychedelic.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher for
  `entropy_from_phases`. `reduce_coupling` and
  `simulate_psychedelic_trajectory` stay as they are —
  `reduce_coupling` is a scalar matrix multiplication, not a compute
  kernel, and `simulate_psychedelic_trajectory` is a wrapper that
  composes `UPDEEngine.run`, `compute_itpc`, `detect_chimera`,
  and the new `entropy_from_phases` dispatcher.
- 16 new tests — `tests/test_psychedelic_algorithm.py` (9
  algorithmic + Hypothesis incl. translation invariance,
  log(n_bins) upper bound, n_bins parameter effect),
  `tests/test_psychedelic_backends.py` (7 cross-backend parity,
  Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go).
- Parity measured at 4.4e-16 on Rust / Julia / Go and 1.2e-12 on
  Mojo (under the 1e-9 tolerance).

### Added (2026-04-18 — poincare multi-backend)
- `julia/poincare.jl`, `go/poincare.go` (→ `libpoincare.so`),
  `mojo/poincare.mojo` (→ `poincare_mojo`) implementing the
  generic hyperplane Poincaré section and the phase-oscillator
  variant (2π wrap detection) with linear interpolation.
- Python bridges `monitor/_poincare_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_poincare_go.py`, `monitor/_poincare_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/poincare.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher with a
  caller-preallocated output convention: both kernels return
  ``(crossings_flat, times, n_crossings)`` where the output
  buffers are sized to ``T * d`` / ``T * N`` (worst case) and the
  dispatcher reshapes the populated prefix.
- 19 new tests — `tests/test_poincare_algorithm.py` (10
  algorithmic + Hypothesis + direction filtering),
  `tests/test_poincare_backends.py` (5 cross-backend parity with
  array-exact crossing counts and 1e-9 coord tolerances),
  `tests/test_poincare_stability.py` (4 long-run invariants,
  `pytest.mark.slow`).
- Parity measured bit-exact across Rust / Julia / Go and 1.5e-18
  on Mojo (subprocess text round-trip).

### Added (2026-04-18 — embedding primitives multi-backend)
- `julia/embedding.jl`, `go/embedding.go` (→ `libembedding.so`),
  `mojo/embedding.mojo` (→ `embedding_mojo`) implementing three
  delay-embedding primitives: `delay_embed`, `mutual_information`
  (Fraser-Swinney 1986), `nearest_neighbor_distances` (k=1 brute
  kNN for FNN).
- Python bridges `monitor/_embedding_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_embedding_go.py`, `monitor/_embedding_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/embedding.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
  Rust has no standalone MI or kNN FFI — the dispatcher falls
  through to the next available backend for those two, while
  keeping Rust's native `optimal_delay_rust` and
  `optimal_dimension_rust` fast paths for the wrappers.
- 25 new tests — `tests/test_embedding_algorithm.py` (12
  algorithmic + Hypothesis), `tests/test_embedding_backends.py`
  (10 cross-backend parity including Rust-active MI/NN
  fall-through), `tests/test_embedding_stability.py` (3 long-run
  invariants, `pytest.mark.slow`).
- Parity: `delay_embed` array-exact, `nearest_neighbor_distances`
  within 3e-17 and array-exact indices, `mutual_information`
  within 1e-9 (histogram bin-edge rounding vs `np.histogram2d`).

### Added (2026-04-18 — recurrence multi-backend)
- `julia/recurrence.jl`, `go/recurrence.go`
  (→ `librecurrence.so`), `mojo/recurrence.mojo`
  (→ `recurrence_mojo`) implementing the Eckmann 1987 recurrence
  matrix and cross-recurrence matrix with both euclidean and
  angular (chord-distance) metrics.
- Python bridges `monitor/_recurrence_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_recurrence_go.py`, `monitor/_recurrence_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/recurrence.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
  `rqa` and `cross_rqa` now always use the dispatched matrix and
  a Python-side line-length analysis for uniform behaviour across
  backends.
- Rewrote `benchmarks/recurrence_benchmark.py` as a multi-backend
  wall-clock harness (was a Rust-only Criterion-style print).
- 29 new tests — `tests/test_recurrence_algorithm.py` (14
  algorithmic + Hypothesis incl. angular-metric correctness),
  `tests/test_recurrence_backends.py` (12 cross-backend parity
  with **array-exact** boolean equality; both metrics),
  `tests/test_recurrence_stability.py` (3 long-run invariants,
  `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_recurrence.md` (475 lines) with
  Eckmann / Marwan formalism, per-backend build notes, measured
  benchmarks, failure modes, and references.

### Added (2026-04-18 — winding multi-backend)
- `julia/winding.jl`, `go/winding.go` (→ `libwinding.so`),
  `mojo/winding.mojo` (→ `winding_mojo`) implementing the
  cumulative winding-number tracker (integer int64 output).
- Python bridges `monitor/_winding_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_winding_go.py`, `monitor/_winding_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/winding.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
- 20 new tests — `tests/test_winding_algorithm.py` (10
  algorithmic + Hypothesis), `tests/test_winding_backends.py` (7
  cross-backend parity with **array-exact** integer equality
  across every backend), `tests/test_winding_stability.py` (3
  long-run invariants incl. additivity across splits, N=64×T=10000
  stress, noise robustness; `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `benchmarks/winding_benchmark.py` multi-backend wall-clock
  harness.
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_winding.md` (395 lines) with winding
  formalism, per-backend build notes, measured benchmarks, failure
  modes, and references.

### Added (2026-04-18 — chimera multi-backend)
- `julia/chimera.jl`, `go/chimera.go` (→ `libchimera.so`),
  `mojo/chimera.mojo` (→ `chimera_mojo`) implementing the
  Kuramoto & Battogtokh 2002 local order parameter per oscillator.
- Python bridges `monitor/_chimera_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_chimera_go.py`, `monitor/_chimera_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/chimera.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
  Classification thresholds + partition stay Python-side.
- 24 new tests — `tests/test_chimera_algorithm.py` (13 algorithmic
  + Hypothesis + exact uniform-circle identity),
  `tests/test_chimera_backends.py` (8 cross-backend parity with
  Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go), `tests/test_chimera_stability.py`
  (3 long-run invariants incl. narrow-kernel ring chimera,
  `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `benchmarks/chimera_benchmark.py` multi-backend wall-clock
  harness.
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_chimera.md` (420 lines) with
  Kuramoto-Battogtokh formalism, per-backend build notes,
  measured benchmarks, failure modes, and references.

### Added (2026-04-18 — dimension multi-backend)
- `julia/dimension.jl`, `go/dimension.go`
  (→ `libdimension.so`), `mojo/dimension.mojo`
  (→ `dimension_mojo`) implementing the Grassberger-Procaccia 1983
  correlation integral and Kaplan-Yorke 1979 dimension.
- Python bridges `monitor/_dimension_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_dimension_go.py`, `monitor/_dimension_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/dimension.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
  Pair-subsampling RNG is now Python-owned and threaded through to
  every non-Rust backend for deterministic cross-backend parity on
  the full-pairs branch; Rust retains its in-kernel RNG for API
  stability.
- 28 new tests — `tests/test_dimension_algorithm.py` (14
  algorithmic + Hypothesis + analytic KY limits),
  `tests/test_dimension_backends.py` (11 cross-backend parity with
  Hypothesis sweeps for Rust / Go), `tests/test_dimension_stability.py`
  (3 long-run invariants, `pytest.mark.slow`).

  harness.
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_dimension.md` (457 lines) with
  Grassberger-Procaccia + Kaplan-Yorke formalism, per-backend build
  notes, measured benchmarks, failure modes, and references.

### Added (2026-04-18 — entropy_prod multi-backend)
- `julia/entropy_prod.jl`, `go/entropy_prod.go`
  (→ `libentropy_prod.so`), `mojo/entropy_prod.mojo`
  (→ `entropy_prod_mojo`) implementing the overdamped-Kuramoto
  dissipation rate Σ (dθ/dt)² · dt.
- Python bridges `monitor/_entropy_prod_julia.py`,
  `monitor/_entropy_prod_go.py`, `monitor/_entropy_prod_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/entropy_prod.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher
  (`ACTIVE_BACKEND`, `AVAILABLE_BACKENDS`).
- 21 new tests — `tests/test_entropy_prod_algorithm.py` (11
  algorithmic + Hypothesis + dispatcher), `tests/test_entropy_prod_backends.py`
  (7 cross-backend parity at 1e-12 / 1e-9),
  `tests/test_entropy_prod_stability.py` (3 long-run invariants
  including a UPDEEngine-coupled synchronisation trace,
  `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `benchmarks/entropy_prod_benchmark.py` multi-backend wall-clock
  harness across N ∈ {16, 64, 256, 1024}.
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_entropy_prod.md` (548 lines) with
  Acebrón 2005 formalism, per-backend build notes, measured
  benchmarks on the local host, failure-mode audit, and references.

### Added (2026-04-18 — itpc multi-backend)
- `julia/itpc.jl`, `go/itpc.go` (→ `libitpc.so`), `mojo/itpc.mojo`
  (→ `itpc_mojo`) implementing Lachaux 1999 inter-trial phase
  coherence (`compute_itpc` + `itpc_persistence`).
- Python bridges `monitor/_itpc_julia.py`, `monitor/_itpc_go.py`,
  `monitor/_itpc_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/itpc.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher
  (`ACTIVE_BACKEND`, `AVAILABLE_BACKENDS`).

  Hypothesis), `tests/test_itpc_backends.py` (10 cross-backend
  parity at 1e-12 for Rust / Julia / Go, 1e-9 for Mojo),

  `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `benchmarks/itpc_benchmark.py` multi-backend wall-clock harness.
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_itpc.md` (453 lines) with Lachaux
  1999 formalism, per-backend build notes, measured benchmarks on
  the local host, and failure-mode audit.

### Added (2026-04-18 — upde engine multi-backend)
- `julia/upde_engine.jl`, `go/upde_engine.go`
  (→ `libupde_engine.so`), `mojo/upde_engine.mojo`
  (→ `upde_engine_mojo`) implementing the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto UPDE
  batched integrator with Euler, RK4 and Dormand-Prince RK45 with
  adaptive step-size control.
- Python bridges `upde/_engine_julia.py`, `upde/_engine_go.py`,
  `upde/_engine_mojo.py`.
- Module-level `upde_run` stateless kernel in `upde/engine.py` with
  5-backend dispatcher (`ACTIVE_BACKEND`, `AVAILABLE_BACKENDS`).
  `UPDEEngine.run` now routes through `upde_run` so every available
  toolchain is exercised.
- Python reference `_upde_run_python` with RK4 / Euler substepping
  + inline Dormand-Prince tableau matching
  `spo-engine/src/upde.rs` bit-for-bit (verified against Rust to
  1e-12, Mojo to 1e-6).
- 42 new tests — `tests/test_upde_run_algorithm.py` (13
  algorithmic properties incl. Hypothesis),
  `tests/test_upde_run_backends.py` (26 cross-backend parity across
  3 methods × multiple seeds), `tests/test_upde_run_stability.py` (3
  long-run invariants, `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `benchmarks/upde_engine_benchmark.py` multi-backend wall-clock
  harness across sizes × methods.
- `docs/reference/api/upde_engine.md` extended with 5-backend
  section + measured benchmark table on the local host.

### Added (2026-04-18 — lyapunov spectrum multi-backend)
- `julia/lyapunov.jl`, `go/lyapunov.go` (→ `liblyapunov.so`),
  `mojo/lyapunov.mojo` (→ `lyapunov_mojo`) implementing the Benettin
  1980 / Shimada-Nagashima 1979 spectrum with RK4 integration and

  `monitor/_lyapunov_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/lyapunov.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher
  (`ACTIVE_BACKEND`, `AVAILABLE_BACKENDS`). `LyapunovGuard` is
  preserved unchanged as a stateful single-backend observer.
- Reference Python kernel switched from forward Euler + coupling-only
  Jacobian to RK4 + driver-diagonal Jacobian + row-oriented QR so all
  backends (Rust, Mojo, Julia, Go, Python) agree bit-for-bit on the
  same problem instance.
- 32 new tests — `tests/test_lyapunov_algorithm.py` (14 algorithmic
  properties + Hypothesis), `tests/test_lyapunov_backends.py` (15
  cross-backend parity, including driver and phase-lag cases),
  `tests/test_lyapunov_stability.py` (3 long-run invariants, marked
  `pytest.mark.slow`).
- `benchmarks/lyapunov_benchmark.py` multi-backend wall-clock harness
  (warm-up + sized sweep at `N ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32}`).
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_lyapunov.md` (643 lines) covering the
  variational equation, Benettin algorithm, row-MGS convention,
  per-backend build notes, measured benchmarks on the local host,
  failure modes, and references.

### Added (2026-04-17 — transfer_entropy multi-backend)
- `julia/transfer_entropy.jl`, `go/transfer_entropy.go`
  (→ `libtransfer_entropy.so`), `mojo/transfer_entropy.mojo`
  (→ `transfer_entropy_mojo`) implementing Schreiber 2000 phase
  transfer entropy (pairwise and full matrix).
- Python bridges `monitor/_te_julia.py`, `monitor/_te_go.py`,
  `monitor/_te_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/transfer_entropy.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
- 14 new tests (8 per-backend parity + 6 stability/slow).
- `benchmarks/transfer_entropy_benchmark.py` multi-backend harness.
- `docs/reference/api/monitor_transfer_entropy.md` (600 lines)
  covering Schreiber TE formalism, 5-backend chain, measured
  benchmarks, physical invariants, comparisons with Granger / PLV /
  PID.

### Added (2026-04-17 — NPE multi-backend)
- `julia/npe.jl`, `go/npe.go` (→ `libnpe.so`), `mojo/npe.mojo`
  (→ `npe_mojo`) implementing the normalised persistent entropy
  and the circular phase-distance matrix.
- Python bridges `monitor/_npe_julia.py`, `monitor/_npe_go.py`,
  `monitor/_npe_mojo.py`.
- `monitor/npe.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
- 17 new tests (12 per-backend parity + 5 stability/slow).
- `benchmarks/npe_benchmark.py` multi-backend harness.

### Added (2026-04-17 — PAC multi-backend)
- Julia port `julia/pac.jl`, Go port `go/pac.go` (→ `libpac.so`),
  Mojo port `mojo/pac.mojo` (→ `pac_mojo` executable) for Tort 2010
  phase-amplitude coupling.
- Python bridges `upde/_pac_julia.py`, `upde/_pac_go.py`,
  `upde/_pac_mojo.py`.
- `upde/pac.py` now exposes `ACTIVE_BACKEND` / `AVAILABLE_BACKENDS`
  and dispatches `modulation_index` / `pac_matrix` fastest-first
  across the five backends.
- `tests/test_pac_backends.py` — per-backend parity (Rust/Julia/Go
  bit-exact, Mojo ≤ 1e-10).
- `tests/test_pac_stability.py` — MI bounded in [0, 1], monotonic in
  modulation depth, diagonal-vs-off for locked signals. Marked
  `pytest.mark.slow`.
- `benchmarks/pac_benchmark.py` — multi-backend wall-clock harness.

### Added (2026-04-17 — order_params multi-backend)
- Julia port `julia/order_params.jl`, Go port `go/order_params.go`
  (→ `liborder_params.so`), Mojo port `mojo/order_params.mojo`
  (→ `order_params_mojo` executable).
- PyO3 export for `compute_layer_coherence`.
- `upde/order_params.py` upgraded to five-backend dispatcher.
- 39 new tests (20 algorithm + 13 per-backend parity + 6 stability).

### Changed — AttnRes upgraded to full multi-head (2026-04-17)

Following the new ``feedback_no_simplistic_models.md`` rule, the
Phase-3 AttnRes spike was upgraded from a single-equation Hebbian
proxy to the full arXiv:2603.15031 Transformer architecture:

- **Full multi-head implementation** — Fourier-feature phase
  embedding (``d_model = 8``), ``H = 4`` attention heads with
  learnable Q/K/V projections (seeded Xavier init via new
  ``default_projections()``), scaled dot-product softmax attention
  (paper-faithful full-N scope; optional ``block_size`` local mask),
  output projection ``W_O``, symmetric cosine-similarity
  aggregation onto ``K_nm``.
- **All 5 backends re-ported** — Rust, Julia, Go, Mojo, Python all
  now carry the full multi-head kernel. Parity: bit-exact
  (5.55e-17) for Rust/Julia/Go; 1.55e-14 for Mojo (text-protocol
  rounding budget).
- **PyO3 signature extended** to carry the four projection buffers
  plus ``n_heads`` and a signed ``block_size`` (``-1`` = unbounded
  full attention).
- **Test coverage** — 20 algorithm tests, 14 per-backend parity
  tests, 3 stability tests (marked slow); 37 AttnRes-specific
  tests total, all pass.
- **Old single-head ports deleted** per the option-B clause in the
  new rule: the simplified kernels would have shipped as toys
  alongside the full model, so they were removed from main rather
  than left to decay.

### Added — AttnRes multi-language fallback chain (Phase-3 spike)
- `coupling/attention_residuals.py` — new ``attnres_modulate`` pure
  function plus multi-backend dispatcher following the global
  fastest-first rule (Rust → Mojo → Julia → Go → Python). Two public
  attributes ``ACTIVE_BACKEND`` and ``AVAILABLE_BACKENDS`` let callers
  see which backends loaded on the current host.
- `spo-kernel/crates/spo-engine/src/attnres.rs` — Rust implementation
  with single-scratch-buffer design, no Rayon (measured slower at
  SPO-realistic N ≤ 64), 11 pure-Rust unit tests, criterion bench in
  ``utility_bench``. PyO3 binding returns
  ``Bound<PyArray1<f64>>`` directly to avoid Vec → PyList overhead.
- `julia/attnres.jl` + `coupling/_attnres_julia.py` — Julia port with
  lazy ``juliacall`` bridge. Bit-exact parity with the NumPy reference.
- `go/attnres.go` + `coupling/_attnres_go.py` — Go port compiled to
  c-shared ``libattnres.so``; ctypes bridge. Bit-exact parity.
- `mojo/attnres.mojo` + `coupling/_attnres_mojo.py` — Mojo port with
  subprocess bridge using a single-line text protocol (Mojo 0.26
  ``UnsafePointer`` C-ABI is in transition; documented upgrade path
  to ``@export(ABI="C")`` + shared library once the pointer surface
  stabilises in 0.27+). Parity within 7.72e-15.
- `benchmarks/attnres_modulation_benchmark.py` — multi-backend
  overhead measurement against the baseline ``UPDEEngine.step``.
  Verified Rust speedup of 2.5–4.5× over the NumPy fallback on
  N ∈ {16, 64, 128, 256}.
- `tests/test_attention_residuals.py` (17 tests) + new
  `tests/test_attention_residuals_backends.py` (13 tests) —
  per-backend parity, symmetry, zero-diagonal, no-new-edges,
  block-window, lambda=0 identity, contract failures, R-within-5 %
  validation against the baseline.
- New global rule at
  `feedback_fallback_chain_ordering.md` — every multi-language
  compute dispatcher across GOTM orders backends fastest-first.

### Changed — type discipline (continued)
- `attention_residuals.py` dispatcher uses a canonical
  ``_BackendFn`` Callable alias so loader functions are strictly
  typed; the only remaining ``type: ignore`` is on the juliacall
  import (juliacall ships no py.typed marker) and is documented
  inline with its reason.

### Security
- `adapters/modbus_tls.py` no longer echoes the full private-key or
  certificate path in `ConnectionError` messages — only the filename.
- `binding/loader.py` scrubs paths from YAML / JSON / missing-file
  errors via `path.name` + `OSError.strerror`.
- `adapters/lsl_bci_bridge.py` stops echoing the configured
  `stream_name` in the "Could not connect" RuntimeError.
- `adapters/remanentia_bridge.py` stops echoing the offending URL
  when rejecting a non-http(s) scheme.
- `modbus_tls` enables `CERT_REQUIRED` + hostname verification when
  a CA bundle is configured (previously `CERT_NONE` by default).

### Added — amplitude metric chain in QueueWaves pipeline
- `PhaseComputePipeline.tick()` now populates `mean_amplitude`,
  `subcritical_fraction`, and `pac_max` on the emitted `UPDEState`
  using a 32-tick rolling window of Hilbert amplitudes. Policy rules
  referencing those metrics now fire as documented.
- `ServiceSnapshot.amplitude` reports the real Hilbert envelope
  instead of a hard-coded 1.0.

### Added — criterion bench suite expansion
- `spo-kernel/crates/spo-engine/benches/parallel_bench.rs` extended
  to cover all salvaged Rayon compute paths (chimera, bifurcation,
  dimension, poincare, market, coupling_est, sindy, kaplan_yorke).
- `spo-kernel/crates/spo-engine/benches/monitors_bench.rs` (new) —
  8 sequential compute paths (spectral, lyapunov, transfer_entropy,
  embedding, recurrence, hodge, entropy_prod, pid).
- `spo-kernel/crates/spo-engine/benches/utility_bench.rs` (new) —
  12 remaining compute paths (basin_stability, itpc, ei_balance,
  splitting, imprint, npe, evs, phase_extract, carrier, ethical,
  connectome, oa_run).
- Coverage across 4 bench binaries is now ~24 spo-engine modules.

### Changed — type discipline
- `src/scpn_phase_orchestrator/server.py` `_lifespan` annotated
  `AsyncIterator[None]` (was missing a return type).
- `tools/benchmark_summary.py` rewritten to use an argv list plus
  `env=` parameter in place of `shell=True` with a `noqa: S602`
  suppression; canonical SPDX header added (the file had none).
- `tools/coverage_guard.py` shebang moved to line 1 (was at line 9
  after SPDX, where the kernel does not honour it); `evaluate()`
  narrows the `dict[str, object]` global threshold via isinstance
  rather than casting directly.
- `tools/generate_header.py` modernised matplotlib calls:
  `add_axes` / `imshow extent` take float tuples; `plt.cm.cool`
  replaced with `plt.get_cmap("cool")`.
- `tools/gpu_benchmark.py` `BENCHMARKS` annotated
  `list[tuple[str, Callable[[], dict]]]`.
- Combined `mypy src/scpn_phase_orchestrator tools/` reaches 176
  files, 0 errors (from 16).

### Added — cross-platform tooling
- `tools/normalise_spdx_headers.py` — one-shot normaliser that
  converts the 6-line merged SPDX variant to the canonical 7-line
  form with `--dry-run` / `--apply` / `--verify` modes. Applied to
  632 files in this release.
- `tools/generate_grpc.py` — cross-platform Python port of
  `generate_grpc.sh`, callable from Windows without WSL.

### Added — FPGA synthesisable Verilog
- `KuramotoVerilogCompiler` now emits Q16.16 fixed-point Verilog that
  instantiates `cordic_sincos` from `spo-fpga/kuramoto_core.v` for
  every non-zero K_ij entry — replacing the previous simulation-only
  `$sin(...)` placeholder. 30-case test suite covers encoding,
  module structure, synthesisability, CORDIC instantiation and the
  summation chain.

### Added — observability
- Structured `logging.getLogger(__name__)` instrumentation on
  `server.py` (lifespan startup / shutdown, api.reset, api.step),
  `server_grpc.py` (Step / Reset RPCs) and `supervisor/policy.py`
  (regime + action count + knob list extras on every `decide()` call).

### Added — concurrent-safety primitives
- `threading.RLock()` around `UPDEEngine.step/run` and
  `StuartLandauEngine.step` so shared pre-allocated scratch arrays
  cannot be corrupted by concurrent callers (multi-client gRPC /
  WebSocket deployments).
- `SimulationState._lock` unified to `threading.Lock`; REST and gRPC
  now serialise against the same mutex.
- `GaianMeshNode` gained `__enter__` / `__exit__` so
  `with GaianMeshNode(...)` releases sockets on exit, including on
  exception paths. FastAPI `create_app` installs an
  `asynccontextmanager` lifespan that clears the event bus on
  shutdown.

### Added — constructor validation
- `UPDEEngine`, `SwarmalatorEngine`, `SimplicialEngine`, `DelayBuffer`,
  `DelayedEngine`, `InertialKuramotoEngine`, `OttAntonsenReduction`,
  `JaxUPDEEngine`, `JaxStuartLandauEngine` raise `ValueError` on
  non-positive `n` / `dt`, negative `sigma²`, zero dim, unknown
  integration method.
- `WebhookAlerter.cooldown_seconds`, `MetricBuffer.maxlen`,
  `PhaseSINDy.threshold / max_iter`, `LyapunovGuard.basin_threshold`,
  `EventBus.maxlen`, `PGBO.cost_weights` all gain up-front validation.

### Performance
- `reporting/plots.py` defers the matplotlib import to the first
  plot call. Importing `CoherencePlot` no longer triggers matplotlib
  backend init or font cache loading on CLI / server paths.
- Salvaged Rayon parallelisation for `chimera::local_order_parameter`,
  `bifurcation::trace_sync_transition`, `dimension`, `market`,
  `poincare`, `coupling_est`, `sindy`, `spo-wasm`, `active_inference`
  from the stalled perf branches. Tests + SPDX / ORCID / Contact
  headers preserved throughout. Dedicated criterion benchmarks added
  in `spo-engine/benches/parallel_bench.rs`.

### Fixed
- `pac_matrix_compute` docstring now matches the implementation
  (row-major, not column-major). Callers must pass `ravel(order="C")`.
- `spo-engine/benches/upde_bench.rs` failed to compile; three call
  sites now pass `&mut cs.knm` to match the `UPDEStepper.step/run`
  mutability contract.
- 26 ruff errors and 8 cargo warnings introduced by this session's
  commits — all cleaned. `cargo check --all` and
  `ruff check src/ tests/ tools/` are zero-warning.

### Changed
- SPDX headers normalised to canonical 7-line format across 632
  files (Python, Rust, YAML, TOML, Shell, Markdown). The previous
  6-line merged `SPDX-License-Identifier: ... | Commercial license
  available` variant is no longer present in-repo.
- `docs/reference/api/{coupling,monitor,upde}.md`, CHANGELOG and
  README no longer use internal quality tier names. Neutral
  descriptive language replaces them.
- Incidental `protoscience@anylum.li` email typo corrected to
  `protoscience@anulum.li` in 9 files.

### Tests — Phase-7 property-based invariants
- `test_property_monitors.py` (new, 6 tests) — PID non-negativity and
  empty-group zero-return; phase transfer entropy bounded by
  `log(n_bins)` for independent signals and for self-TE; Kuramoto
  supercritical monotonicity (R at K=1.0 is at least R at K=0.4 within
  a narrow frequency spread) and incoherent-state ceiling at K=0.
- `test_property_engine.py` (new, 4 tests) — UPDE ``step`` is
  equivariant under oscillator-index permutations (compared modulo
  2π on the torus); identity permutation is fixed bit-for-bit;
  Dense↔Sparse CSR parity for both Euler and RK4 across Hypothesis
  sparsity masks (10–90%).

### Tests — CI-tool defensive coverage
- `test_bench_compare_baseline.py` (new, 14 tests) — the CI
  benchmark-regression guard is now under test: PASS/FAIL branches,
  list + dict baseline layouts, missing-key / zero-baseline skip,
  CLI argv length and malformed JSON surfaces.
- `test_tools_normalise_spdx.py` (new, 23 tests) — SPDX split logic
  (`#` / `//` / bare), typo fix, `HEADER_SCAN_LIMIT`, excluded dirs
  and `.venv` prefixes, iter filter, dry-run vs apply atomicity,
  verify mode exit codes.
- `test_tools_coverage_guard.py` (new, 32 tests) — validator bounds
  (NaN/Inf rejected), domain parser (Windows-style paths included),
  Cobertura XML parser, thresholds schema, per-global / per-domain /
  per-file evaluation branches, main() integration.
- `test_tools_check_version_sync.py` (new, 9 tests) — pyproject /
  CITATION / Cargo version extraction; nested `[dependencies]
  version = ...` not mis-matched; mismatch and missing-file exits.
- `test_tools_check_module_linkage.py` (new, 15 tests) — module
  discovery (`__init__.py` excluded), import-path construction,
  linkage via dotted import or `test_<stem>` reference, allowlist
  schema validation, stale-entry detection, `--allow-stale-allowlist`
  bypass.

### Tests — S6 THIN file strengthening
- `test_ffi_parity.py` 4 → 15 (Sakaguchi lag, external drive,

  fusion / cell keyword routing; case-insensitive regex; decade
  scaling; eight oscillators per layer; empty prompt fallback).
- `test_quantum_bridge.py` 2 → 17 (constructor guards; import_artifact
  defaults and edges; import_knm validation; round-trip).
- `test_active_inference_agent.py` 2 → 11 (directionality,
  target_r bounds, learning rate effect, repeated-call stability).
- `test_viz_streamer.py` 2 → 11 (defaults, primitives, empty
  containers, multi-dim, list-of-arrays, numpy dtypes, broadcast
  no-client and before-start fast paths, deep nesting).
- `test_lsl_bridge.py` 3 → 12 (constructor defaults,
  HAS_LSL=False short-circuit, no-stream-found case, stop-before-start
  idempotence, pure / noisy / empty phase extraction, scrubbed
  error message).

### Fixed

- **Contract drift**: Loader now resolves extractor_type aliases to algorithm names at parse time. Both `physical` and `hilbert` are valid input; internally normalized to algorithm names.

- **Stuart-Landau coupling**: clamp `r >= 0` in `_derivative` to prevent sign-flip in RK intermediate stages
- **CLI audit logger**: simulation loop wrapped in `try/finally` to guarantee `close()` on exception
- **Hilbert guard**: `PhysicalExtractor.extract()` validates signal shape before transform

- **Exception swallowing**: `except Exception` → `except ImportError` in stuart_landau.py and pac.py
- **Coupling diagonal**: layer-scoped K update zeros `knm[idx,idx]` after row/column scaling

- `docs/index.md`: added 6 missing nav entries to match `mkdocs.yml` (concepts, specs, gallery)
- `mkdocs.yml`: added `references.bib` to Reference nav section
- `README.md`: quickstart now includes `spo scaffold` example
- `ruff.lint.ignore`: added `S603` (subprocess in tests is expected)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **[P0]** Rust `LagModel` propagated NaN distances into alpha matrix; now rejects NaN/Inf distances with `IntegrationDiverged`
- **[P0]** `RegimeManager.transition()` took redundant `current` param that could diverge from `self._current`; removed for Python↔Rust parity
- **[P0]** Merge duplicate `validate_binding_spec` — canonical version now in `validator.py` with all checks merged

- **[P1]** Rust UPDE stepper did not check omegas/knm for NaN/Inf; now rejects with `IntegrationDiverged`
- **[P1]** `PhysicalExtractor._snr_estimate` always returned ~1.0; replaced with envelope-CV metric
- **[P1]** `UPDEEngine.compute_order_parameter` reimplemented inline; now delegates to canonical implementation
